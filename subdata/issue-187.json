Aim facilitates gaining deeper insights, thus enhancing the quality of experimentation.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe following changes are made in the codebase\r\n- Created `AimCallback` to track input prompts and agent replies, in a separate `aim.py` file.\r\n- Added cli option `--aim-repo` to give a specific Aim repo path if needed.\r\n- Passed an instance of `AimCallback`: `aim_callback` to track the logs in `start_interaction_loop` method \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI've included in-code comments to make it easy for the reviewer to understand.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI executed Auto-GPT with some tasks and thoroughly explored the Aim UI during the response period of the interaction loop.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\nThere is no need for any specific tests. By running Auto-GPT and examining Aim explorer, you will have all the information you need.\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3101/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3101/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
