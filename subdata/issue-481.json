Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n> Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). Unless otherwise stated, it is recommended to pass args as a sequence. If the shell is invoked explicitly, via `shell=True`, it is the application\u2019s responsibility to ensure that all whitespace and metacharacters are quoted appropriately to avoid [shell injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_injection#Shell_injection) vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nNow passing command line args as list, not formatted string. No longer setting `shell=True`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.
