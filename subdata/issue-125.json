It uses GPT-4 and works very well.\r\nTo boost the command it would be ideal to accompany it with another command called \"learn_api\", based on [danielgross LlamaAcademy](https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy), an excellent project aiming at automate API learning for LLMs.  \r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\n[SebRinnebach autodebug](https://github.com/SebRinnebach/autodebug) for Python.\r\n\r\nSee also issue https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3686\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nThe current Auto-GPT commands set does not include the function to fix source code files executing them, reading the error messages and changing the source code iteratively until no more errors are reported.  \r\n\r\nCurrently there are 3 commands relative to handling source code:  \r\n -  autogpt.commands.analyze_code  \r\n -  autogpt.commands.execute_code  \r\n -  autogpt.commands.improve_code  \r\n  \r\nWhat is missing is a command that just fix the errors in the code, like this:  \r\n -  autogpt.commands.autodebug_code  \r\n  \r\n[SebRinnebach autodebug](https://github.com/SebRinnebach/autodebug) for Python uses GPT-4 and works very well. It should be considered as a model to follow for the new command.  \r\n  \r\nIt could also be boosted by adding a function to learn API from docs:  \r\n -  autogpt.commands.learn_api  \r\n  \r\nFor example [danielgross LlamaAcademy](https://github.com/danielgross/LlamaAcademy) is an excellent project aiming at automate API learning for LLMs. It should be studied or even integrated into Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\nAlso, all commands should be converted into plugins. The plugin model is much more consistent and extensible.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3445/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3445/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
