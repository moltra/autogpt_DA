Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nCurrently, we are having tests in the `tests` directory, the `tests/unit` directory, and the `tests/integration` directory. Aside from that, some tests are named using the `test_*.py` naming convention, while others are named using the `*_test(s).py` naming convention. The CI is set up to only execute the tests in the `tests` directory and looks for files with the `test_*.py` naming pattern by default. The inconsistency in location and naming causes the wrong tests to be executed in the CI and/or the right tests to not be executed in the CI. To address this issue, tests have been named with the `test_` prefix where needed and have relocated to the `tests/unit` or `tests/integration` folders. The CI then only executes the unit tests as they can be executed without the need of third-party services, which we currently can not run in the CI and/or for which we don't have API keys specifically meant for the CI (as far as I know).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Rename test files to the `test_*.py` naming pattern\r\n- Relocate tests to either `tests/unit` or `tests/integration`\r\n- Remove duplicate tests (`json` & `json_parse`)\r\n- Join similar tests from different files (`browser` -> `browse_scrape_links`)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- README.md has been updated about test file naming convention\r\n- README.md has been updated about difference `unit` and `integration` tests\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- The unit tests in the CI should succeed\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change. N/A\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts. N/A\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1725/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1725/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
