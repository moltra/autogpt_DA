Method type of calls and ingestions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1694\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17609011/233582040-831eb36b-fce0-46c6-aef1-14d001070ed0.png\">\r\n\r\nTo achieve client generation for any REST API which supports OpenAPI spec openapi command was added, where we generate REST API client using openapi-python-client, instantiating it and injecting in commands, based on config provided to users.\r\n\r\nAny APIs  added to openapi_commands.yaml and whitelisted in OPENAPI_APIS envs would be fetched for \r\nOpenAPI spec of OpenAI manifest and all methods found would be added to Auto-GPT commands.\r\n\r\nFor any REST API added to the config, we have:\r\n\r\n* OpenAPI(Swagger) spec parsed and each endpoint-method ingested as separate commands\r\n* OpenAI manifest is generated and saved in ./plugins/openapi/{api_name}/ai-plugin.json making it OpenAI plugins generator\r\n* Custom python client package is generated and placed ./plugins/openapi/{api_name}/client\r\n* Making changes in manifest/openapi spec/client anyone can effectively develop new API plugins, or adjust them.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\nAll added methods are covered with unit tests.\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Future plans\r\n\r\n* Add Authorization support\r\n* Add ability to generate plugins in Auto-GPT runtime when it's hitting rest API's supporting OpenAPI schema.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2642/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2642/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
