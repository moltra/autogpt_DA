While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe purpose of this change is to provide a more efficient and flexible memory backend for storing memories. The proposed memory backend uses SQLite and Zarr to store data and embeddings locally in a compressed and chunked format. The implementation is based on the work of [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory). The implementation can be easily adapted to support the local embeddings model implemented in #1320. The change is related to the issue [#430](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/430#issuecomment-1501170016), where the idea of using SQLite a memory backend was suggested.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Implemented a new memory backend that uses SQLite and Zarr for storing data and embeddings as an alternative to Redis or Pinecone\r\n- To use, either set the config option `memory_embeder` or the environment variable `MEMORY_EMBEDER` to **sqlite**.\r\n- Updated requirements.txt with zarr and sklearn dependencies\r\n- Added `/memory/` to .gitignore to avoid committing the database and embeddings files\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- The code changes are documented using docstrings and comments\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- Created a unit test module to test if everything works as intended.\r\n- Further testing might be required for out of sync issues between the database and embeddings\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1457/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1457/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
