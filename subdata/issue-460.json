I personally can supervise Spanish and Ukrainian.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a different task of changing the UI to be in other languages. This task is only about the replacement of core prompts.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is fully engineered prompts in different languages, and the ability to select between them.\r\n\r\nSo, the goal of this issue is to prepare a guide and a code framework for such porting.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nYou can end your goals with \"speak in Spanish\", and I guess there were some language flags as well\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nChatGPT speaks many natural and artificial languages, and it speaks popular languages speaks pretty well. So getting Chinese, Spanish, Hindi, and Arabic support is essential in order for the project to get more testers and contributors.\r\n\r\nOr any other relatively popular languages as I guess \"what do you mean by Chinese\" is a valid question.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1563/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1563/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
