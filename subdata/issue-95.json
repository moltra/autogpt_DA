Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nI feel that \"question\" and \"summary\" are bad words to use when prompting an AI to extract data from a webpage. They're too general. Thus, I fixed the browse prompt to reflect my opinion. This ended up significantly improving GPT-3's performance in summarizing website content. By telling it to use maximum detail, the browse outputs won't get (as) decreasingly verbose and simple, which would lead to a bad final summary. The caveat of this is potentially using more tokens because the summaries will be longer, but at least the AI won't be neutered by bad browsing functionality.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it so you won't go homeless from needing to use GPT-4 to get decent website summaries.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nChanged the browse prompt to be more effective.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nNothing is added, only changed. No documentation necessary (I don't think).\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI've tested this over the course of many different prompts on my own repo and I can say confidently that this alternate browse prompt significantly increases the quality of the summary returned. You'll see that the summaries are much, much more information dense and character-efficient. Example outputs are below; compare with current performance:\r\n\r\nOutput 1:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCOMMAND = browse_website ARGUMENTS = {'url': 'https://rimworldwiki.com/wiki/Events', 'question': 'What are the different types of events in Rimworld?'}\r\n\r\nSYSTEM:  Command browse_website returned: ('Answer gathered from website: The different types of events in Rimworld include Major Threats, Extreme Weather, Random events, Incidental events, Faction events, Sub-events, Game Endings, and Legacy events.

The fact that I can't find where the initial prompt is anymore prevents me from making this change myself. If anyone wants to make this change or inform me how to do so, it'll happen, but I think this would be a fine PR merge even without that.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3551/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3551/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
