This PR is a mkdocs, read the docs style 'doc as code' site that can house the documentation for the site. People inundating the discord with questions? Knock much of it out by pointing to good docs.  \r\n### Changes\r\nAdded a docs folder with md files overviewing and providing examples for all for all of the python files in the scripts folder. \r\nAdded a mkdocs yaml\r\nAdded two requirements to the requirements.txt\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nSo the whole purpose of this is to provide a read the docs style site with loads of examples. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nmkdocs has been and built on my pc. \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [NA] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\nThe tests for mkdocs are maintained in their library and no additional/ functional 'code' has been added to the repo. The only addition is a mkdocs style docs folder with markdown, no functional impact to users, but will allow for collaborative documentation editing.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/897/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/897/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
