Look for my \"batches\" for inspiration. This is an example:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are duplicates, choose one primary issue and put the duplicate issues along the PRs in the second-level lists. We can tell PRs from issues by the icons.\r\n\r\nNote that you must be able to tell a defect from non-defect (in a necessarily subjective way). For example:\r\n\r\n- Something that is caused by flaky GPT response (e.g. not answering in JSON, not giving proper instructions to agents and so on) is a prompt engineering defect. Those should not be considered genuine defect for the purpose of this issue, as they are hard to fix and require benchmarking that we don't currently have handy\r\n- Something that adds a new thing is not a defect. E.g. we had logging. If the logging is not broken and works as it's planned during its creation, then it's not a defect\r\n- Something that causes a stack trace is always a defect. Ideally, we should only have error messages, and the traces will be shown only in the debug mode. This will greatly improve the UX for the non-technical users, while imposing a moderate reproduction hassle on developers. With Auto-GPT being a pop star this is essential. I'm not a Pythoner so I ask if this is implementable at all (e.g. in JS you can display the error stack trace in the catch handler at will)\r\n- Something that makes AutoGPT unusable for a layperson is a defect as long as it doesn't require a major overhaul (e.g. Ctrl-C displaying a stacktrace would be considered as a defect)\r\n\r\nThis doesn't require an approval to anyone, and it shouldn't be intrusive. Try doing a small list and if people don't start screaming on you go on. Work with complaints on your own too, when people say that this is defect and this is not (they certainly will, it's what people do). This is the right way to silently contribute, as the main team don't have time to review and approve all the activities.\r\n\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThis is the current list of defects as defined by @nponeccop in #...\r\n\r\n- #803 \r\n  - #804 \r\n  - #696 \r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nWith the now infamous `debug_mode` breakage, we need to figure out the current list of defects, and merge fixes for defects first. So, it's important to classify the current issues and figure out the list of the priority PRs to merge before the \"batches\" process.\r\n\r\nNote that the batches process is prioritized by the PR number, so once your PR is valid (e.g. reviewed to be clean and mergeable), and got into a batch, and is not a big feature, you can be sure that it will be merged in this batch as long as you fix the conflicts. This is IMO an important motivation for the PR authors, that we essentially will merge all old small good PRs in the FIFO order.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/926/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/926/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
