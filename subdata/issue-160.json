While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThis change was inspired by user request in issue #1035, aiming to improve the user experience of Auto-GPT by providing clear information about the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action. This enhancement is particularly useful for users who pre-authorize commands and want to track their progress.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn this pull request, the following modifications were made to the `agent.py` file:\r\n\r\n1. Added a conditional statement `elif` under the main control flow to handle cases where `self.next_action_count > 0` and `cfg.continuous_mode` is `False`.\r\n2. Used the `logger.typewriter_log()` function to display the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action, including the command name and its arguments.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments and this external documentation, which clearly explain the new behavior added to Auto-GPT after merging this pull request. The number of authorized commands left will be displayed in cyan color when the user is not in continuous mode, and the details of the next action, including the command name and its arguments, will be displayed in both continuous and non-continuous modes.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTo test this functionality:\r\n\r\n1. Ran Auto-GPT with the updated `autogpt/agent/agent.py` file .\r\n2. Pre-authorized commands using `y -n`, where `n` is the numerical value of commands you want to authorize.\r\n3. Observed the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action being displayed after every message in the specified color when not in continuous mode.\r\n4. Verified that the output aligns with the expected behavior as described.\r\n\r\nFlake8 and PyTest run without any issues.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box.
