The implementation should be fully backward compatible. The implementation migrate the current ai_settings.yaml to a project structure but do not change the core , it change the back end.\r\n\r\n* Now = AutoGPT can have 1 agent\r\n* New back-end = AutoGPT can have 1 project with 1 agent\r\n* Future = AutoGPT can have N project with 1 agent each \r\n* Future ++ = AutoGPT can have N project with N agent each \r\n\r\nThe new back-end is further detailed in REAME.md\r\n* AIConfig, is an empty class that inherit from AgentModel (for backward compatibility without changing core variable name)\r\n* AgentModel, is a representation of an Agent and manage CRU of an Agent.\r\n* Project, is a common goal to various Agent and manage CRU of this project and D of Agent (not yet implemented)\r\n* ProjectsBroker, create & manage projects\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* \u2795Documentation : Created a projects/readme.md to help user & developper alike to work on the projects\r\n* \u2795Tests : 3 new pytest files\r\n* \u26d4\ufe0f `AIConfig` : Fully removed and kept for backward compatibility so the core is not modified\r\n* \u2795 `AgentModel` : Added\r\n* \u2795 `Project` : Added\r\n* \u2795 `ProjectsBroker` : Added\r\n\r\nChanges that affect core : \r\n* \u26a1 `prompt.py` a consequence of the abstraction layer was that `def construct_full_prompt(ai_config, prompt_generator: Optional[PromptGenerator] = None) -> str:` had to be moved out `AIConfig` \r\n* \u26a1 1 line in main.py to reflect the change above\r\n\r\nRisk : \r\n* Manage circular imports as the backward compatibility requires imports from Agent to ProjectBroker & the setup is designed to work with imports from ProjectBroker to Agent.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* Every method will be fully doc stringed\r\n* README.md created\r\n* Variable created in .env template should be documented if any\r\n* Any twitch inserted for backward compatibility must have a # TODO and if possible PROJECT-DEPRECATED tag.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n* Unit test with pytest \r\n* Publication of the branch on Discord & request for testers. \r\n\r\nScenarii : \r\n\r\nMVP : \r\n* [x] Start a first instance of AutoGPT without ai_settings.yaml\r\n* [ ] Start an instance of AutoGPT with ai_settings.yaml \r\n* [x] For any of the instance above save & quit after after at least 1 interaction with the agent\r\n* [ ] Start the instance above and see if the agent can load (type y)  & quit after after at least 1 interaction with the agent\r\n* [ ] Start the instance above and see if we can create a new agent(type n)  & quit after after at least 1 interaction with the agent\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change. \r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes. **FULL BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY**\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3549/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3549/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
