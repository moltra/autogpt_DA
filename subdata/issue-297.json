The goal is to restructure the code base to make it more maintainable and scalable by leveraging asynchronous agents, a modular design, and an enhanced plugin system.\r\n\r\nWe encourage everyone to participate in the discussion and link their related PRs that contribute to the implementation of this architecture.\r\n\r\n#### Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Design and document the new async modular architecture possible including an async AICore, server integration, and expanded plugin system.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to join the discussion and link any PRs that you feel are related to this issue. Your contributions and insights are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nCurrent contributions to this approach:\r\n#449 #757 #765 #1937  #2442 ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2458/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2458/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
