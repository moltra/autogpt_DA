While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThis pull request adds a check for CAPTCHA or \"I am not a robot\" to the Selenium web scraper in order to address the issue of human blocking. Previously, the scraper would continue to run despite such checks, leading to inaccurate results. This enhancement ensures that the scraper can collect accurate data from the website.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nThe scrape_text_with_selenium function in the selenium_scraping.py module was modified to add a check for CAPTCHA or \"I am not a robot\" by searching for those strings in the page source. If either string is found, the code pauses execution and prompts the user to complete the check before continuing. This change ensures that the scraper can accurately collect data from websites that have human blocking in place.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nThe changes are documented in the code using comments that describe the purpose and functionality of the added check. Additionally, this pull request includes documentation in the form of a README file that explains how to use the web scraper and how to contribute to the project.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nTo test this functionality, we ran the web scraper on several websites that have CAPTCHA or \"I am not a robot\" checks in place. In each case, the scraper paused execution and prompted the user to complete the check before continuing. We also tested the scraper on websites without such checks to ensure that the functionality was not impacted by the added check.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2299/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2299/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
