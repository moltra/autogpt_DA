While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nI find myself typing \"y\" over and over or mistyping and giving human feedback by accident. I think if I do not have any and just want to continue, just hitting enter instead of having to type \"y\" is a benefit.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- adding empty input as condition\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nadded change to readme\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2252/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2252/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
