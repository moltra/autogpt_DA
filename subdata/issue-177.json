the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n**This is a resubmit of PR #2069, which got a little messy. This is a cleaner version of that. Tested & working.**\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to pause a continuous loop. When we input \"y -X\", where X is some number, there is a desire to be able to pause the AI and input some human feedback, then have the AI continue on its trajectory, as noted here  #563 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nUses can pause a long loop with just 3 key presses. Hold \"SHIFT\" and press \"P\" twice. Then users can enter feedback + have the loop automatically continue.\r\n\r\n\"Shift + P + P\"\r\n\r\n**User friendly UX**\r\nOn the 2nd iteration of a loop, the message _\"Thinking....\"_ changes to _\"Thinking... Hold Shift & press 'P' twice to give feedback to the AI\"_\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe person must click into the same code window where the code originally ran, then hold \"Shift\" + hit \"p\" twice\r\n\"SHIFT + P + P\" will bring pause the loop on the next run, so that someone can entire feedback to the AI.\r\nThis way, instead of having to stop a long loop, you can just pause it, give feedback, and have the loop continue.\r\n\r\nThe clicks will not be detected if the active windows is something besides the running code window.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested several iterations on Windows, to ensure that expected behavior is experienced (it is).\r\n\r\nRequest that someone tests this on Linux.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [\u2714\ufe0f] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [\u2714\ufe0f ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ \u2714\ufe0f] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ \u2714\ufe0f] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ \u2714\ufe0f] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\nEdit: Updated with documentation on README\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
