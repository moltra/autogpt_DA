Def would love to play with that again for sure. The hardcoded \"you are naughty dont break format again\" should do the trick for now. \r\n\r\nLearned something doing this one, you cant give it an ounce of an idea a human is at the console, it just overrides the world. You cant even use words like \"human\", breaks it right out of the box.
