The rationale is to improve the user experience when listening to the TTS output.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made:\r\n\r\n1. Update the `_speech` function with an additional line of code to remove URLs from the input text using a regular expression.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\n#... macOS TTS code ...\r\n\r\ndef _speech(self, text: str, voice_index: int = 0) -> bool:\r\n    text = re.sub(r'\\b(?:https?://[-\\w_.]+/?\\w[-\\w_.]*\\.(?:[-\\w_.]+/?\\w[-\\w_.]*\\.)?[a-z]+(?:/[-\\w_.%]+)*\\b(?!\\.))', '', text)\r\n    #... remaining macOS TTS code ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Imported the `re` library to handle regular expressions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe new code removes URLs from the input text using a regular expression. The `re` library was imported to handle regex patterns, and the URLs are removed from the text using the `re.sub` function. The code has an appropriate in-line comment explaining the purpose of the change.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Test various input text strings containing URLs and verify that the URLs are removed from the TTS output.\r\n2. Test the functionality with multiple different voices to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
