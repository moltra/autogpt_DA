So, I took a stab at creating a module for working with react apps and adding github versioning functions. If anyone has any input or is willing to help me test this please ping me! \r\n\r\nDon't know how safe it is to update the prompt either, seems to \"on the nose\"\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis pull request adds the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Added react_operations.py module for React app management\r\n- Added git_operations.py module for GitHub repository management\r\n- Added environment variables for GitHub username and PAT in the .env file\r\n- Updated the execute_command() function to include new React and GitHub commands in the AI agent prompt\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nWIP(will circle back on this on Friday evening)\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/364/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/364/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
