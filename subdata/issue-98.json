On first iteration this function always sends a prompt to GPT. But what if we had auto-gpt running and then stopped it manually before running a command (or had a power outage)? And then we want it continue running from this command? What was the reasoning behind making auto-gpt always run from ground up, even if there is available `ai_settings.yaml` and we want to continue running with it?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that hard to support it, we will just need to preserve `full_message_history` and not clear `memory` on each run (and also do the same for every agent in agent_manager I guess). So I'd just like to know why this feature hasn't been considered initially? I can think and try to implement it, but first I need to understand if it doesn't go against the design of the project.\r\n\r\nThere are some active issues addressing it like https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1176 or https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/822, but it doesn't seem that they also address the core issue that `start_interaction_loop` always run initial prompt for some reason, what was the reasoning behind that (and why don't we allow to persist message history between `auto-gpt` launches)?\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nIt will be pretty convenient for cases when for example user shutdowns their pc or electricity crashes and their auto-gpt stops running, and they want to continue running from the **exact** step they were stopped at.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3542/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3542/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
