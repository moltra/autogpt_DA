If the file gets beyond a few paragraphs this starts to cause issues often time causing json parsing error. Could we somehow have it insert text into an existing file. Maybe we can have it give vim commands to edit it.\r\n\r\nBeen running a benchmark of having it write a fluid simulation using the lattice boltzmann method. Been running this everyday for a week or so to see the progress of Auto-GPT developments. I think it is very close to working but need this one last bit of functionality.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nHere is an example that I think shows gpt is capable of doing it.\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-04-10 12-03-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4978408/230974929-033d978a-7ede-4bd4-b8dc-d6709afccfb8.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-04-10 12-02-52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4978408/230974919-dad15015-8279-42a5-99d9-5d3094edc19f.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nThis would allow for Auto-GPT to modify and improve itself ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/727/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/727/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
