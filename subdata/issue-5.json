While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nTo run execute_python_file, which is currently built into autogpt, user needs to install docker and create docker-image separately, which you feel is unnecessary and unreasonable. (I watched multiple issues because of this, for example #92 #1896 )\r\nIt is likely to be a difficult task for beginners or those who are not familiar with Docker use.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nTherefore, in python execution, the venv mode and the Docker mode were separated and implemented so that the user could choose how to execute the code in the .env file.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nRelevant information is annotated in code as comments\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nSame environment, I tested docker mode(legacy) and venv mode and they work same.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [v ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [v ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [v ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [v ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [v ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3713/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3713/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
