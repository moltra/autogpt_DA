Once we have a few, we can then create them in one go.\r\n\r\nOfc, labels are a dynamic thing, so it's only natural this topic might need to be revisited in the future again.\r\n\r\nTo make the work easier, I've exported the repo's PRs and issues into the following Google Sheet (it should be editable for everyone).\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qzpNNmHXBz0aEuORs9qS8Xgp-tRzoGCkreF7fse72jQ/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nSome suggestions so far:\r\n- \"non-atomic\" (#609, @nponeccop) - Label for PRs where people do several things at once\r\n- \"topic: web browsing\" (@jurooravec) - Related to the web browsing feature, including both its implementation and issues arisen during web browsing \r\n- \"topic: file system\" (@jurooravec) - Related to instances where Auto-GPT created or wrote into (or failed to) files.
