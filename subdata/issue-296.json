While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThere's no easy way to test new master pull requested packages. With this new workflow, we can see the latest changes and pull request to master, uploaded to TestPyPi and test the new package (as long as the version number in pyproject.toml file is incremented properly).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nCreated a new file, pypi-publish.yml as a new pipeline.\r\nA couple of lines in pyproject.toml file to have a working `python -m build` \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nRepo owner needs to set a new Repository secret called, `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`. Get the API Token from https://test.pypi.org/\r\nFor each new change and about to release a new version, update the pyproject.toml file with a new version and set it up as a new pull request. This will trigger the workflow and upload it to testpypi.\r\n\r\nTest the package by `pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ auto-gpt==<new version number>`\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested by running the workflow myself and uploaded to my test account's project. (Now removed)\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2506/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2506/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
