But **it visits only the first website in a list** returned from the google command. It **overlooks other relevant websites found in the search**. Instead of visiting all of them, it conducts a new google search and browses only the first returned website again.\n\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\n\n1. Auto-GPT started well, by conducting a Google search on the topic. \r\nCOMMAND = google ARGUMENTS = {'input': 'ambipolar aether particles'}\r\n\r\n2. Command google returned **8 websites**, some of them relevant. \r\n\r\n3. Auto-GPT decided to browse the website of the first search result to gather more information.\r\nCOMMAND = browse_website ARGUMENTS = {'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smtd.202000837', 'question': 'ambipolar aether particles'}\r\n\r\n4. Command browse_website returned: ('Answer gathered from website: The text does not mention \"ambipolar aether particles.\"\r\n\r\n5. Instead of browsing other websites from the first Google search, where the required information is present, Auto-GPT decided to conduct a new Google search to find websites that provide the needed information.\r\n\r\n6. This behaviour repeats - upon not finding relevant information in the first website from a list returned by a Google search, it makes a new Google search, thus missing relevant websites already found in previous Google searches.\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nEach Google search returns a list of possibly relevant websites.\r\n\r\nAuto-GPT should browse all websites in a list returned from the Google search, not just the first one. After the whole list of websites is browsed and if nothing relevant is found (or not enough of relevant information is found), it should conduct a new Google search.\r\n\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\nai_goals:\r\n- Collect information on ambipolar aether particles from the web, including research\r\n  from Correa, Aspden, Cope and others.\r\n- Prepare a joint physical model describing nature and principles of ambipolar aether\r\n  particles.\r\n- Prepare argumentation how the resulting model extends the standard model of particles.\r\n- Write the resulting model and argumentation to file.\r\n- Shutdown upon achieving your goals.\r\nai_name: Research-GPT\r\nai_role: an AI designed to autonomously browse the web and conduct physical research\r\n  on the topic of ambipolar aether particles\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\n\n_No response_", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3635/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3635/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
