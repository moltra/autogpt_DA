Would you prefer I make this only show if the user passes in a flag like `python -m autogpt --report_budget`?\r\n- I find it useful to also include the total budget. But if this is too noisy I can remove it\r\n- There were circular import issues. So the import is done in the function. Alternatively, I could make larger changes to the codebase, but this seemed the simplest change to make. Let me know if you want me to take another path.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3313/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3313/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
