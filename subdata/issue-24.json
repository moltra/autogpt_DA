created, you have to click \"n\" for each plugin you don't want to use - enabling DENYLISTED_PLUGINS will increase usability.\r\n\r\nThere is another PR: 3254 enables this env variable, but also changes the env variable and Config field names, making it potentially more disruptive to users.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nInstead of only reading in the allowlist, the code has been updated to check for a DENYLISTED_PLUGINS environment variable and, if found, populate a plugins_denylist attribute on the Config class with its contents.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe plugin documentation in the plugin repo will need to be updated to mention this setting. I'll do that as a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have tested with existing tests and local manual testing. Existing tests cover this change.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n\r\n### No new tests\r\n- Existing tests cover this change.\r\n- Additionally, the Config singleton would be affected, which could lead to other tests failing.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3688/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3688/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
