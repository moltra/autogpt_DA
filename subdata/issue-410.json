With this, having different \"prompt files\" per model since some models respond to prompts differently than others is also helpful.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, pluggable embeddings to give people the option to run locally or use different embedding models.  \r\n\r\nI tried to make it easy to work with in my BabyAGI port.  If any of the code in my examples is useful for this, absolutely feel free to use it.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nI started to do this with BabyAGI.  Trying to keep up with all of the large changes to the code here is making it impossible for me to add this after each merge.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM (Note - under development)\r\n\r\nExample of openai provider\r\nhttps://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM/tree/main/provider/openai\r\n\r\nExample of oobabooga text generation web UI provider\r\nhttps://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM/tree/main/provider/oobabooga\r\n\r\nExample of openai embedding\r\nhttps://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM/tree/main/embedding/openai\r\n\r\nExample of longformer embedding to run locally\r\nhttps://github.com/Josh-XT/Agent-LLM/tree/main/embedding/longformer\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nGiving people the ability to choose a different AI provider will enable people to use Auto-GPT on their own custom models or other models out in the wild besides GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.  While GPT-4 is the best out there, it would help a lot for development to see how other models do given the same objectives for research and development.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1854/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1854/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
