To create your common lisp project I will be using `evaluate_code` to write Lisp code directly into files. I will create a directory called `lisp-project` in the current working directory to save your project files. The first file in your project will be called `wave-collapse.lisp`. \r\n\r\nHere is some code to create a new directory and a template for `wave-collapse.lisp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n;; create new directory for project files\r\n(progn \r\n  (defvar *project-dir* \"lisp-project/\")\r\n  (ignore-errors (ensure-directories-exist *project-dir*)))\r\n\r\n;; create initial file for wave function collapse\r\n(with-open-file (stream (merge-pathnames \"wave-collapse.lisp\" *project-dir*)\r\n                        :direction :output \r\n                        :if-exists :supersede)\r\n  (write-line \";; Wave Function Collapse Algorithm in Common Lisp \\n\" stream)\r\n  (write-line \"(in-package #:cl)\\n\" stream)\r\n  (write-line \";; define your functions and macros here \\n;; good luck!\" stream))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about these steps?\r\n  \r\n  System: Command Error: threw the following error: 'dict' object has no attribute 'replace'\r\n\n\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\n\nVery often, when trying to parse complex return values from the ChatGPT API, this errors shows up. It is very likely to be a result of a yet to be handled special case of bad JSON. But it's hard to say. It might be something easy as well, if one knows Python.\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nThe error should not occur and the parsing out the API data should be smooth sailing\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\n# create a new common lisp project in the local filesystem which implements the wave function collapse algorithm.
