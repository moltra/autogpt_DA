If I'm wrong on that one, I would very much appreciate some advice.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI would have written a unit-test to prove the error - if I had any idea on how to :) Sorry, but the is the first time ever, that I have opened a PR against some python-code.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
