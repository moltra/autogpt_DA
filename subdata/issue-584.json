Can be used to summarize multiple urls in parallel depending on num_sources requested (default is 1)\r\n* Moved main loop into an async function to be asyncio.run from  main.\r\n* Had an issue with Pinecone memory clear() so put it in try/except\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\ntest_search - test_search_and_summarize_multiple_sources get 5 links from google_official_search and creates summaries from 3. It fails on the NYT and generates the third summary from the 4th url. (can't really build on this flow)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\nI ran main with --continuous for a while it was stable.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/386/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/386/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
