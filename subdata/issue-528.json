While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nREST API because:\r\n- soap is old, graphql is oftentimes overkill and not very beginner friendly, gRPC is not yet supported widely by web browsers\r\n- websockets endpoints will be needed but only to complement the REST API to get live updates. For example if I want to create an agent as a frontend engineer, I don't need to do it through websockets. But websockets will be needed to subscribe to channels (conversations, debugging info, logs, I have many of these channels ready in a branch). These channels will allow a human to understand what his agents are doing, but they can also be used by a mother autoGPT to orchestrate its children.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAdded:\r\n- the POST /agents endpoint\r\n- the docker-compose.dev.yml and dockerfile_dev because we need one.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nRepo of the api following this structure:\r\n```\r\nAuto-GPT/\r\n\u251c\u2500 autogpt/\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 models/ ## defines the class that will interact with the DB\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 agent.py\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 tests/ ## tests within the main module, this is very common\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 v1/ ## versioning is key\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 features/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 agents/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 create_agents\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 start_agents\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 stop_agents\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 conversation/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_conversation\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 commands/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_commands\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 prompt/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_prompts\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 goals/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_goals\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 metrics/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_metrics\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 events/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 subscribe_events\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 etc...\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 unit/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 conftest/ ## configuration for tests\r\n\u251c\u2500 v1/\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 endpoints/ ## all the routes here\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 agents.py\r\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 router/\r\n\u2514\u2500 static/ ## api documentation, very useful to integrate\r\n```\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.
