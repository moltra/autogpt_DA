By setting the default docker compose to mount a volume on the host, at least the output files should persist.  This will allow follow on runs to potentially ingest these.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis adds the auto_gpt_workspace to the volumes in the docker-compose.yml\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThis change should be self-explanatory\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested this locally\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n\r\nI did not add tests because this is a configuration change that should be straightforward.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3434/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3434/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
