Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->\r\n\r\nOne issue I have seen while experimenting with AutoGPT is that it will go deep down irrelevant rabbit holes. In order to address this I am experimenting with having a more structured way of organizing tasks.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the changes made in this pull request. Be specific and detailed. -->\r\n- `TaskManager`: A singleton class responsible for managing tasks, including creating tasks, retrieving tasks by ID, updating task states, and displaying task hierarchy.\r\n- `TaskState`:An enumeration representing the state of a task (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED).\r\n- `Task`: A class representing individual tasks with properties like ID, name, state, parent task, and subtasks.\r\n- New `--taskmanager` command line flag to enable and disable\r\n- New commands for managing tasks: `update_task_state` and `set_current_task`\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->\r\n\r\n- Add unit tests for Task Manager, Task, and TaskState\r\n\r\n### Outstanding items\r\n\r\n- Refine prompt to ensure AutoGPT is always managing tasks\r\n- Allow for programmatically adding task manager portion of prompt based off command line flag\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/495/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/495/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
