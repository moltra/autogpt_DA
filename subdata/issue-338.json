While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe image gen could use a custom stable diffusion checkpoint, but the model url is actually hardcoded\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\n- Change image_gen.py to take env in account\r\n- Change config.py to retrieve .env and set self.huggingface_api_url from HUGGINGFACE_API_URL\r\n\r\n```python\r\nself.huggingface_api_url = os.getenv(\"HUGGINGFACE_API_URL\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Change .env.template\r\n- Change README.md\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nJust adding a env, if it's not set it will fallback to current hardcoded url\r\n```python\r\nAPI_URL = CFG.huggingface_api_url or \"https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nChange .env var to one of the following, checkpoints are available here : \r\n[https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.15.0/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img#diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.15.0/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/text2img#diffusers.StableDiffusionPipeline)\r\n\r\n- stable-diffusion-v1-4 (512x512 resolution) [CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4](https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)\r\n- stable-diffusion-v1-5 (512x512 resolution) [runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)\r\n- stable-diffusion-2-base (512x512 resolution): [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-base)\r\n- stable-diffusion-2 (768x768 resolution): [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2)\r\n- stable-diffusion-2-1-base (512x512 resolution) [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base)\r\n- stable-diffusion-2-1 (768x768 resolution): [stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1)\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
