While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThis pull request introduces a new functionality to the `Agent` class, allowing a default number of authorizations to be set for the `start_interaction_loop()` method. During our work, we also addressed an issue with `next_action_count`, which was being treated as a string instead of an integer, causing a `TypeError` when attempting to decrement its value.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Implemented a new `default_authorisation_count` parameter in the `Agent` class.\r\n- Updated the `__init__` method of the `Agent` class to cast `next_action_count` to an integer.\r\n- Ensured that `default_authorisation_count` is also cast to an integer when updating `next_action_count`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes made in this pull request have been documented through in-code comments and this PR message.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n- Run the application with various inputs to ensure the TypeError does not occur anymore.\r\n- Verify that `next_action_count` is correctly updated and decremented as intended during the interaction loop.\r\n- Test the new `default_authorisation_count` functionality to ensure it works as intended.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2037/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2037/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
