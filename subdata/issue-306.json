The commands would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(\r\n  \"Schedule Task\", \r\n  \"schedule_task\", \r\n  {\"task_id\": \"<task_id>\", \"task\": \"<task_desc>\", \"date\": \"<date>\", \"time\": \"<time>\", \"repeat\": \"<interval/none>\"}\r\n),\r\n(\"List Scheduled Tasks\", \"list_scheduled_tasks\", {}),\r\n(\"Remove Scheduled Task\", \"remove_scheduled_task\", {\"task_id\": \"<task_id/all>\"}),\r\n(\"Wait for Task Trigger\", \"wait_for_task\", {\"task_id\": \"<task_id>\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI asked GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to explain these to me and verified that they both understand what \"<interval/none>\" and \"<task_id/all>\" mean.\r\n\r\nWhen a scheduled task is triggered, it injects the task into the latest memory, and then either removes it or re-schedules it. Whether or not it was re-scheduled should be stated to GPT-4 so it doesn't attempt to do so unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\"Wait for Task Trigger\" just provides sleep functionality if the agent is waiting on something, to save tokens.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nAs an example use case, any agent communicating asynchronously online would want to regularly check for responses. If its future tasking is reliant on responses then it can sleep between checks, otherwise it can do other things in the meantime.\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nThis provides AutoGPT with the long-term self-discipline that alarms afford to us humans. While I wouldn't say it provides long-term planning capabilities (unless testing reveals it uses these commands for that purpose), as it is time-based rather than sequential tasking-based, it's a simple stepping stone towards that.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2409/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2409/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
