While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nCurrently, the plugin has provided an interface that can replace OpenAI's text completion, but for users who want to run everything locally, using custom models for embeddings is also very necessary.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nIn `autogpt/models/base_open_ai_plugin.py` add `can_handle_text_embedding(...)` and `handle_text_embedding(...)`.\r\n\r\nIn `autogpt/llm_utils.py` add `for plugin in CFG.plugins:...`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\ntests/unit/models/test_base_open_api_plugin.py passes\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2804/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2804/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
