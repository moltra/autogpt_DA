The changes improve the code's readability and maintainability, while also addressing potential edge cases that could lead to issues in JSON processing.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- Refactored the existing JSON fixing and parsing functions to make them more modular.\r\n- Improved exception handling and error messages to provide better debugging information.\r\n- Added type hints and comments to make the code more readable and maintainable.\r\n- Updated the function documentation to better explain their purpose and usage.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments and updated function docstrings. The new code follows the project's coding standards and conventions, making it easy to understand and maintain.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n- Test the updated JSON parsing and fixing functions with various JSON inputs, including valid JSON, JSON with missing or extra braces, and JSON with invalid escape sequences.\r\n- Test the updated functions with edge cases and inputs that could potentially lead to issues in the original implementation.\r\n- Ensure that the changes do not introduce any new bugs or regressions.\r\n- \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\nx  My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\nx I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\nx I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\nx I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\nx I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2094/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2094/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
