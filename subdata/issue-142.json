searched the existing issues, and there is no existing issue for my problem\r\n\r\n### Which Operating System are you using?\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Which version of Auto-GPT are you using?\r\n\r\nMaster (branch)\r\n\r\n### GPT-3 or GPT-4?\r\n\r\nGPT-3.5\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\r\n\r\nLet autogpt scan a local php project directory and ask it not to clone the directory.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\r\n\r\nautogpt will fire off the command search_files together with args (\"extension\" ), while all these args are not defined at all in the \"def search_files\" function, which is located in: autogpt\\commands\\file_operations.py\r\n\r\nresulting in errors:\r\n\r\n _\"command\": {\r\n        \"name\": \"search_files\",\r\n        \"args\": {\r\n            \"directory\": \"gegevens/www\",\r\n            \"extension\": \"php\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nDEBUG:LOGGER:\r\nSYSTEM: Command search_files returned: Error: search_files() got an unexpected keyword argument **'extension'**\r\nSYSTEM:  Command search_files returned: Error: search_files() got an unexpected keyword argument **'query'**\r\nSYSTEM:  Command search_files

search_files() got an unexpected keyword argument **'keywords'**\r\n-- the keywords one is different, it came like this:\r\nsearch_files  ARGUMENTS = {'directory': '/_auto-GPT2/agent/autogpt/auto_gpt_workspace', 'keywords': ['milk', 'water', 'eggs', 'flour', 'sugar']}\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\nExpected behavior is:\r\nto have all the arguments supported in the function\r\nto have the path taken from the arguments (in some cases it queries the search_files() function with \\path\\to\\filename.ext)\r\nto have the argument \"keyword\" supported when it contains an array of keywords to match the filename against.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**I fixed it in the below function (autogpt\\commands\\file_operations.py), but I guess there is much more, or you should fix it on the side of where the actual command is formed:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n@command(\"search_files\", \"Search Files\", '\"directory\": \"<directory>\", \"extension\":
