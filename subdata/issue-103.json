When using latest release I got errors when loading URLs all the time, even wrong URLs were loaded when using Chrome as selenium browser. Also there were problems with lots of pages having cookie concent popping over the page, making the logic collapse as the cookie concent page were scraped by AutoGPT instead of the real page (after the concent which wasnt done).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis change adds 2 configurable settings for the .env file, you can add a Chrome user-data-dir which is already logged in to all pages needed avoiding the Cookie concent problem. Also you can enable fixing the errors so many people are reporting on windows, and now it all works great.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI belive the changes should be selv explanatory, I did add some comments describing aswell.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nShould be tested on windows where you have problems with loading URL, there are loads of people reporting this.\r\nQuick google search for the typical error: https://tinyurl.com/2jffs89j \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\nI havnt added tests, as I do not know how I add tests. :(\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3519/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3519/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
