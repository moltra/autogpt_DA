Since MemoryProviderSingleton is an abstract class, it doesn't make sense to create an instance of it. Instead, you can define its methods as static methods that can be called without instantiating the class. This will reduce unnecessary memory usage and improve performance.\r\n\r\nCache the results of get_ada_embedding() function. Since the get_ada_embedding() function is called repeatedly, it can be a good idea to cache its results to avoid making redundant API calls. One way to do this is to use a dictionary to store the embeddings with the text as the key.\r\n\r\nUse list comprehension instead of for loops. List comprehension can be a more efficient way to create a list than using a for loop with an append() statement.\r\n\r\nUse f-strings instead of string concatenation. F-strings can make the code more readable and faster than string concatenation.\r\n\r\n<!-- \u26a0\ufe0f At the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.
