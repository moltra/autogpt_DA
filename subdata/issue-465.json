Old data as well, which is already part of its training dataset.\r\nWhich makes it heavy, and consume a lot of tokens.\r\nEg: In one research I was doing, it was referring to an article from 2013, which when I search on ChatGPT, it already had it in its training dataset.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Force AutoGPT to search web only for data post-2021 if it feels its dataset is outdated. Else refer to currently trained OpenAI dataset. \n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\n_No response_", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1514/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1514/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
