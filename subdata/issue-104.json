fails to `write_to_file` if file already exists and returns `Command write_to_file returned: Error: File has already been updated.` and can loop over again and again trying to write to that file\r\n\r\nto bypass this behavior, i had to remove the line manually `write: hello.py` from the `file_logger.txt` each loop for Auto-GPT keeps on working on the file.\n\n### Current behavior
