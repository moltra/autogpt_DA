While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nFor future development it will be interesting to see if AutoGPT can work together with locally running LLM. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis is currently just a WIP of the integration of Oobabooga text-generator-ui API as local LLM. It is marked as Draft because it is not finished yet. Triggering the API works, but the results are far from optimal. It seems the AI does not understand that it should format its result in a specific manner.  \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nNo real documentation yet. Also part of the WIP.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nRunning Auto-GPT locally with a Oobabooga API running on my local network. I think I can add some unit- or integration tests. \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\nI haven't added any tests yet, because this is a WIP/Draft. I do not wish it to be merged yet, but want to use the PR to track the changes. \r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3032/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3032/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
