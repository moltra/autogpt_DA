Looked around the open issues but haven't seen this suggestion yet\r\n\r\nFirstly, I'd like to know that whatever is running is always logged (maybe that's addressed somewhere)\r\n\r\nSecondly , I'd like a \"Cautious\" Monitored Continuous Mode\r\nWhere, a GPT 3.5 or other model, can see the live logs, and will trigger a PAUSE on the system for the following reasons:\r\n- Exceeding Token Costs\r\n- Runaway ML scenerios \r\n- Potentially Harmful/Immoral procedures \r\n\r\nI'd like to have some settings for time delays between executions or inside parts of the loop.\r\nAnd ultimately the ability to Pause a run, Save it, (potentially edit its state while not running), and Resuming  the run finally. The pause can be triggered by the monitoring system, and resuming should only happen with user authorization.\r\n\r\nOnce this is a thing alerts would be the next step", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/151/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/151/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
