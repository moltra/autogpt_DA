Please help me write an introduction to the paper. The structure of the introduction should include three parts: background, context, and unsolved problems.\r\nGoal 2: The background should be about the development and application of big data and machine learning. The context should focus specifically on inventory management of new products under big data and machine learning.\r\nGoal 3: Both the background and context should highlight the importance of inventory management under the big data background, where product cycles are short, quantities are large, and managing inventory for new products without historical data is particularly important.\r\nGoal 4: The unsolved problems should be approached from the industry and academic perspectives. The main points to focus on include the challenges of utilizing large amounts of data in the industry, and the lack of inventory management models that incorporate real-time data in academic research. For example, the article \"Feature-Based Nonparametric Inventory Control with Censored Demand\" may not be applicable to real-world scenarios.\r\nGoal 5: Please refer to journals such as Management Science or Operations Research as much as possible.\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
