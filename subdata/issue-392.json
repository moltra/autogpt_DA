To do this, we could give a list of straightforward instructions that can be passed to GPT-4. The text generated by a \"stupid\" AI will be of lower quality than the one generated by a \"smart\" AI. However, even a \"stupid\" AI can potentially produce results that match those of a \"smart\" AI. It certainly just needs more iteration, focus, and a list of simple instructions that he has to follow. It's important to have the AI think before he writes anything to autogpt ( critique-plan process of a single sentence).\r\n\r\n1 Choose a sentence to work on.\r\n2 Compose an impactful sentence.\r\n3 Critique the sentence for clarity, coherence, grammar, and overall effectiveness. 4 Create a plan for revising the sentence, considering the critique. 5 Evaluate the plan to ensure it addresses the issues identified in the critique. 6 Refine the plan as needed.\r\n7 Rephrase the sentence according to the refined plan. 8 Repeat steps 2-7 for additional sentences.\r\n9 Merge the revised sentences.\r\n10 Showcase the integrated text\r\n\r\nFor the performance evaluation, the AI has a tendency to be a bit adhd, Added refocusing criteria might help.\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history.
