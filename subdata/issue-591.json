Perhaps we could implement a refinement check before proceeding on a task, and use some sort of sentiment analysis from hugging face to then turn that into a Boolean of continue or refine. Then if it still fails after 3 or so retries it could ask a question back to the user for help where it got stuck. \n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nJarvis integration with hugging face https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS\r\n\r\nPaper on refinement technique: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366.pdf?utm_source=aibreakfast.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-every-company-will-use-chatgpt-s-retrieval\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nThe goal would be to trade speed for accuracy in an automated fashion for difficult problems. Some tasks might require higher accuracy and this could be a way to improve the results without waiting for a more sophisticated model.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/442/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/442/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
