In the case of reading text from files like documents (word .doc), (word .docx), or (pdf) we are limited by the binary representation of these files. Also in the case of some interpretable files like (HTML, XML) a lot of boilerplate text is loaded which could be a huge drawback if the loaded text is sent to chatgpt API. A command that can read text only from different files based on the extension would help: 1) Accept more files as input 2) Reduce the number of tokens sent to chatgpt model.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we provide a new command \"read_text_file\" that reads textual information from a variety of file like (.txt | .csv | .pdf | .doc | .docx | .json | .xml | .yaml | .html | .md | .tex )\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdding the command \"read_text_file\" in file_operation.py \r\nAdding respective utilities for each file extension as a separate file \"file_operation_utils.py\"\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nFor testing purposes, a set of functions to create mock files is provided (pdf mock file is hard coded in order to reduce external package usage)\r\nA test case is implemented to loop through all mock file creation.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3031/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 1, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3031/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
