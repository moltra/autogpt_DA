This could be similar to the \"continuous mode\" feature, but it should be a \"continuous up until this particular price\".  So it can give the robot freedom to search for information to try to do something, up until a certain budget has been met.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI'd like to set more robots up to run, I'm afraid of them going off the rails and driving my bill up.
