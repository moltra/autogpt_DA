Making the voices configurable in .env makes it easy to choose voices without have to edit code.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded support for 3 new config variables, one for each voice option. If no voice is specified in .env, Auto-GPT will default to Allison, Ava and Samantha, which are all voices that are commonly preinstalled with MacOS, as far as I know. If the default voice specified by Auto-GPT is not installed, MacOS should default to whatever voice is set in System Settings.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe new code is easy to understand without documentation.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI ran through several different scenarios with speech enabled. Note that I did not test every possible voice.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
