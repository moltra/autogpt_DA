As you may know, we currently have a large number of approved PRs that need to be merged into our codebase. However, we want to ensure that we merge them in a way that minimizes the number of conflicts that arise.\r\n\r\nWe are hoping to find a tool that will help us determine the optimal order in which to merge these approved PRs. Specifically, we are looking for a tool that can analyze the changes in each PR and identify any potential conflicts that may arise when merging them with our codebase. Ideally, this tool would also suggest an order in which to merge the PRs that minimizes the number of conflicts.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions for tools that can help us with this process, we would greatly appreciate your input. Additionally, if you have any experience with a similar issue or have any best practices to share, we would love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nPlease join the discussion on discord as well: https://discord.gg/autogpt", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2002/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 4, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2002/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
