When I run the command, I receive the following error message:\r\n\r\n\"Error: 'PosixPath' object has no attribute 'is_relative_to'\"\r\n\r\nI am running the latest version of Auto-GPT and Python 3.11.0 on macOS. I have tried running the command with different file paths and permissions, but I keep encountering the same error.\r\n\r\nThe second issue Description: When attempting to execute a Python file in the workspace using the Auto-GPT command execute_python_file, an error message is returned stating \"Invalid file type. Only .py files are allowed.\" The path to the Python file and workspace are correctly specified in the command. This error prevents the Python file from being executed and impedes the workflow of the Auto-GPT program.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide guidance on how to resolve this issue?\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\nto search my system if I have python 3.11 or not.\r\n\r\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nfirstly, i have installed python 3.11, so do I need to restart for it to be activated, or you are already aware\r\n(this is the prompt)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\r\n\r\n```log\r\nSYSTEM:  Human feedback: firstly, i have installed python 3.11, so do I need to restart for it to be activated, or you are already aware\r\n THOUGHTS:  Before we proceed, let's confirm that Python 3.11 is installed and working properly. We can do this by checking the version of Python installed on your system.\r\nREASONING:  It is important to ensure that Python 3.11 is installed and working properly before we proceed with the assignments. This will help us avoid any issues that may arise due to an incorrect installation or version of Python.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Check the version of Python installed on your system to confirm that Python 3.11 is installed and working properly.\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to ensure that Python 3.11 is installed and working properly before we proceed with the assignments.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_python_file ARGUMENTS = {'file': '<path_to_python_file>'}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-= \r\nExecuting file '<path_to_python_file>' in workspace '/Users/---/Downloads/Auto-GPT/Auto-GPT-0.2.2/auto_gpt_workspace'\r\nSYSTEM:  Command execute_python_file returned: Error: Invalid file type.
