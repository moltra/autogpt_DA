While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nThe community added smaller unit tests created recently, however we need more integration tests to make sure AutoGPT is not regressing with updates and acting the way it should. Functions can work in the smaller test, but can break with Agent utilization.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nThis new \"tests/integration/goal_oriented/scrape_text.py\" file focuses on creating one new integration test. \r\n\r\nThis test aims to verify the functionality of an AI agent that is designed to scrape the price of a book from a specific webpage (http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/meditations_33/index.html) and write it to a file named \"test_scrape.txt\". The agent is limited to using the scrape_text command for obtaining the book price, writing it to a file, and the task_complete command to complete the task.\r\n\r\nThe test is useful to be added to the integration tests in the new repository because it ensures that the AI agent can effectively interact with webpages using the scrape_text command and write the scraped information to a file. By doing so, it validates the agent's ability to perform web scraping tasks and integrate the results into the desired output format (in this case, a file). This test serves as a real-world example of how the AI agent can be utilized for web scraping tasks and helps ensure the agent's reliability and accuracy for similar use cases.\r\n\r\nThis test should be completed within 25 seconds (usually ~19 seconds)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThe only change to this pull request is an added integration goal_oriented pytest file named \"scrape_text.py\" that was adapted from \"test_write_file.py\" in the same tests/integration/goal_oriented folder.\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\nTime for testing: The goal_oriented integration tests take longer than the smaller mock and unit pytests. However, they are needed to ensure Agents are acting correctly with the existing Auto-GPT process.  \r\n\r\nThis test should be completed within 25 seconds (usually ~19 seconds)\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nin Terminal :  \r\n   cd Auto-GPT  \r\n   pytest tests/integration/goal_oriented/test_scrape.py\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38794445/234408600-e1f54832-09e0-47f1-a3d2-9d852d3d7e73.png)\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
