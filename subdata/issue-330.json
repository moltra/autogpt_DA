Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe current link in `5. Configure Auto-GPT` step of the Installation section has a link to the `\u26a0\ufe0f OpenAI API Keys Configuration \u26a0\ufe0f`  but the link is broken.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nFix the link.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation.

Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nAll needed test, in this case, is to open the page and click on the link. It worked as expected.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2308/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2308/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
