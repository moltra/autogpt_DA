This decision has been based on prior discussions with the development team and aligns with our goal of making the project more flexible and adaptable to future needs.\r\n\r\nIssue: #2458 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Implemented an async agent for handling asynchronous tasks and improving performance.\r\n- Rearchitected the code base for modularity, separating concerns into individual components and making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.\r\n- Updated relevant internal APIs to work seamlessly with the new architecture. \r\n- Need to incorprate #765 \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- Updated the in-code comments to reflect the new async agent and modular architecture.\r\n- Updated the external documentation, including diagrams and explanations, to provide a clear understanding of the new structure and its benefits.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Set up a local development environment with the latest changes.\r\n2. Test the async agent by triggering multiple tasks concurrently and verifying their successful completion.\r\n3. Test the modular components by checking their individual functionality and ensuring they work seamlessly together.\r\n4. Conduct performance tests to ensure the new architecture maintains or improves upon the previous performance benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2442/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 1, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2442/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
