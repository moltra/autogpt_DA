While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nI see the TODO when browsing code\r\n```\r\n# TODO: have this directory live outside the repository (e.g. in a user's\r\n#   home directory) and have it come in as a command line argument or part of\r\n#   the env file.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it seems have competed \ud83e\udd14 \r\n\r\nSo I run it with command line argument, seems work\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1217\" alt=\"CleanShot 2023-04-30 at 13 39 22@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52438637/235338501-902349ce-c79a-4274-a7ec-7db598781fbb.png\">\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2023-04-30 at 13 40 10@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52438637/235344142-feb1a55e-0dc3-411d-a451-6d58ec67110c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw `workspace_path` still can not set by ENV variable, so perhaps we can give it one.\r\n\r\nI am still not sure the format of AI setting YAML file, so I not touch this part.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Add environment variable `WORKSPACE_PATH` to set workspace_path\r\n2. Remove maybe redundant TODO\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. I have test locally about command line argument and .env file setting. Both success.\r\n2. Command line argument might have higher priority than environment variable.\r\n3. Test in other OS might be needed\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [v] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [v] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [v] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [v] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [v] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3572/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3572/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
