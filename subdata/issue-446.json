While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nI always had a hard time reading next steps from Auto-GPT. Especially when I let it run in continuous mode and then checked the result after some time: Reading up on what it has done was difficult:\r\ne.g:\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-15 at 15 21 59\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7549295/232226482-0ff2648d-6b8f-4d4d-90b1-5d21fc5439d7.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nNow there are new lines written for every new action. This way it's easier to read for the human eye:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-04-15 at 15 19 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7549295/232226329-c68d75cc-d970-463d-bda1-d66f3cfa49e4.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nDocumented in code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nSee screenshots above. I expect manual testing this small change is sufficient.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1569/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1569/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
