This feature aims to enhance the user experience for non-native English speakers and improve the overall effectiveness of Auto-GPT. By providing AI assistance in optimizing prompts, we can make the platform more accessible and user-friendly, encouraging a wider range of users to engage with and benefit from Auto-GPT.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1585/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1585/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
