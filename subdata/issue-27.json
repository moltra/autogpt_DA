While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nUpon a thorough review of the existing implementation (#3531), it was discovered that the self-feedback mechanism was not being called as an input. Consequently, the AI was unable to utilize the generated self-feedback for improvement. Additionally, it was observed by me that the feedback prompt was insufficient in providing true feedback, further limiting the AI's potential for growth.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nEnhanced the self-feedback parsing process to optimize the AI's utilization of feedback for improvement and efficient prompt usage. Modified the feedback_prompt to better align with the task of generating and incorporating feedback, leading to more accurate and appropriate feedback. Additionally, updated the unit test for the self-feedback function to verify the correctness of the generated feedback response and ensure it reflects the input thoughts provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI documented my code using inline comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code and to provide additional context where necessary.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\n- I tested this functionality by performing the following steps:\r\n- Updated the existing unit test and created a new unit test specifically designed to verify the correctness of the generated feedback response and ensure it reflects the input thoughts provided.\r\n- Set up a sample thoughts dictionary containing keys such as 'reasoning', 'plan', and 'thoughts'.\r\n- Created a fake response that aligns with the updated feedback_prompt.\r\n- Utilized a mocking library to mock the dependencies and isolate the functionality being tested.\r\n- Ran the unit tests locally on my development machine to ensure they passed successfully without any issues.\r\n- Repeated the test with various input thoughts and fake responses to cover different scenarios and edge cases.\r\n- In addition to unit tests, I ran several varying agents locally, such as \"make me money\" and \"autogpt wiki,\" and tested the self-improvement feature to ensure that it works as intended with different agent configurations.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3680/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3680/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
