To address this need, I have implemented the --lang and --searchregion parameters for our script.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n    Added two parameters for script execution: --lang and --searchregion\r\n    Example usage: python scripts/main.py --lang fr --searchregion fr-fr\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nThe newly added parameters --lang and --searchregion have been documented within the script using inline comments. \r\n```shell\r\n python scripts/main.py --lang fr --searchregion fr-fr\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nI have tested this functionality with french and english and somes prompt exemples. The application retrieves search results in the specified language and region as expected. Further testing will be conducted to ensure compatibility with other existing features.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes ", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1310/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1310/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
