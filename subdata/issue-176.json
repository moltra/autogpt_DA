But I can't figure out how to start Auto-GPT there now. I got as far as the terminal, but it doesn't go any further. I tried the usual commands like \"run\" or \"python -m autogpt\" or \"shell\" or \"docker-compose run --rm auto-gpt\", but they don't work. A button, as shown in a video, to start in the browser does not exist for me. \r\nUnfortunately I can't find any instructions for it anywhere.\r\n\n\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\n\na\r\nAutoGPT doesn't start in codespace\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nAutoGPT starts in codespace\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\n# Paste your prompt here\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\n\n```log\r\n<insert your logs here>\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3188/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3188/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
