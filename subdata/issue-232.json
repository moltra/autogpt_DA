We believe that a manifesto is crucial in fostering a unified vision for AGI development, ensuring that our work is ethical, responsible, and focused on benefiting humanity.\r\n\r\nHaving a manifesto offers several benefits:\r\n\r\n- It serves as a moral compass, guiding our actions and decisions throughout the development process.\r\n- It fosters a sense of unity and shared purpose among our diverse community of contributors.\r\n- It communicates our commitment to transparency, inclusivity, safety, and ethical design to stakeholders and the public.\r\n- It helps us navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by AGI, ensuring that we harness its transformative potential for the betterment of society.\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear your thoughts on the manifesto and invite you to collaborate on refining it. We believe that our collective wisdom and expertise will only strengthen the document, making it an even more powerful guiding force in our work.\r\n\r\nTo contribute your ideas and suggestions, please review the [manifesto draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dzRpN6SuPa1CB8h1zPdV_aHHdLWlJDwm1ESOwH2IUHQ/edit?usp=sharing\r\n) and leave your comments, or submit a pull request with any proposed changes. We look forward to working together to shape the future of AGI, united by our shared values and dedication to making a positive impact on the world.\r\n\r\nPlease make suggestions and comments here:\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1dzRpN6SuPa1CB8h1zPdV_aHHdLWlJDwm1ESOwH2IUHQ/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nThank you for your ongoing support and collaboration!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nSwifty\r\n\r\nGithub @SwiftyTheCoder \r\nDiscord: Swifty#1347\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2808/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2808/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
