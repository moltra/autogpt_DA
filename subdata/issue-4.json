This may mess up user's default python environment. In stead, the script should prompt user for agreement of installing the dependencies, so that user can decide whether to use an venv or conda environment to setup the environment for Auto-GPT.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n```\r\n$ ./run.sh\r\nThe script is going to install Python dependencies with /usr/bin/pip. Proceed? [y/N]: y\r\n<pip install...>\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI like to keep my default python environment simple, with only the most used packages. For all other specific projects I will create venv or conda env to avoid version conflicts and all other weird conflicts in development environments. This is a good practice.
