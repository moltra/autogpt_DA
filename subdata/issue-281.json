This is my first pull request, so please bear with me if I make any mistakes \ud83d\ude04. In this pull request, I have added Russian translations for the README, CODE OF CONDUCT, and CONTRIBUTING files. To indicate the availability of the translated version of the files, I have also added a Russian flag icon in the main README file.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this pull request is to improve accessibility for Russian-speaking users. I have created a new `docs/translations` subfolder to store all the translated files. This will make it easier for users to find and access the translations. In the future, if needed, we can also add translations for other languages.\r\n\r\nI apologize in advance for any errors or typos in the translations. If you notice any mistakes, please do not hesitate to point them out. I would be grateful for any feedback and will correct the errors as soon as possible. You are also welcome to commit directly to my pull request. Thank you!\r\n<!-- \u26a0\ufe0f At the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.
