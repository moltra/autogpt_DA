To address these issues, a pull request has been submitted that simplifies and refactors the repetitive code using new helper methods, making the code more concise, organized, and easier to manage.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Refactored repetitive code: The pull request introduces new helper methods such as __run_plugins_pre_instruction_, __generate_reply_, __run_plugins_on_instruction_, and __run_plugins_post_instruction_ to simplify and refactor the repetitive code. These methods are designed to make the code more concise and organized, reducing the redundancy and making the codebase easier to manage.\r\n\r\n- Simplified create_agent and message_agent methods: The pull request uses the newly created helper methods to simplify and enhance the _create_agent_ and _message_agent_ methods. By leveraging the new helper methods, the code in these methods becomes more concise and easier to read, making it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code.\r\n\r\n- Removed unnecessary code: The pull request also removes unnecessary code that is no longer needed after the refactoring process. This makes the codebase more streamlined and easier to maintain, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocumentation will be added.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCI workflow.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2799/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2799/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
