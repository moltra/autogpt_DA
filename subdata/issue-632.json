This feature combines the benefits of Continuous Mode with the human-in-the-loop experience of Active Mode.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two modes available:\r\n\r\n1. \"[Continuous Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/#-continuous-mode-%EF%B8%8F),\" which allows the AI to run without user authorization and is 100% automated. However, this mode is not recommended due to its potential dangers, such as running indefinitely or performing actions that users might not approve.\r\n2. \"[Active Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/13),\" which enables the AI to run while actively prompting the user with chain-of-thought questions when executing each subsequent action. This allows users to actively participate while the AI agent runs, ensuring a human-in-the-loop experience.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance user engagement and provide a more flexible experience, I propose a new feature called \"Semi-Active Mode.\"\r\n\r\n## Feature Description\r\n\r\nIn \"Semi-Active Mode,\" the AI will:\r\n\r\n1. Execute an action.\r\n2. Evaluate its confidence in the action or result.\r\n3. If the confidence is below a certain threshold, prompt the user for assistance or clarification.\r\n4. Incorporate the user's input and continue to the next action.\r\n\r\nThis interaction pattern allows users to assist when needed while still benefiting from the AI's capabilities. It strikes a balance between full automation and active participation, fostering a collaborative environment between the user and the AI system.\r\n\r\n## Example Implementation\r\n\r\nHere's an example implementation using LangChain's [Human-As-A-Tool](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/human_tools.html) feature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent\r\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType\r\n\r\nllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)\r\nmath_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)\r\ntools = load_tools(\r\n    [\"human\", \"llm-math\"], \r\n    llm=math_llm,\r\n)\r\n\r\nagent_chain = initialize_agent(\r\n    tools,\r\n    llm,\r\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\nagent_chain.run(\"What is Eric Zhu's birthday?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, the AI agent seeks human assistance when it encounters uncertainty, allowing the user to guide as needed.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n-  Enhanced user engagement\r\n-  Reduced risk of AI performing unwanted actions\r\n-  Increased collaboration between the user and the AI\r\n-  Balances automation and user control\r\n\r\n## Risks and Mitigations\r\n\r\nThis feature may slow down the overall AI operation due to the need for user input in certain situations. However, this trade-off is acceptable, considering the increased control and collaboration it provides.\r\n\r\n## Request for Comments\r\n\r\nI would appreciate feedback from the community on this suggested feature.
