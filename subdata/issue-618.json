For example, you can create a module for file operations, another for memory management, and so on.\r\n\r\nError handling: Improve error handling by providing more informative error messages and handling edge cases that might cause the program to crash.\r\n\r\nCode readability: Add more comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each function and its expected inputs and outputs.\r\n\r\nTesting: Write unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected and to catch any potential issues during development.\r\n\r\nSecurity: Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as code injection.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Use a configuration file or environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys, rather than hardcoding them in the script.\r\n\r\nLogging: Implement a proper logging system to track the application's activities and make debugging easier.\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/276/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/276/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
