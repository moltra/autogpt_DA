This is meant to address the issue of poor data quality on the Internet. Right now I've encountered the following actions:\r\n-If the first article returned isn't relevant, a different query is formed\r\n-The first result is often used to develop new tasks\r\n\r\nBut as well know, a lot of the top content on the internet is low quality / commercial, so shouldn't be relied on.\r\n\r\nI suggest to add the following reasoning:\r\n-Use first N results for making decisions (N configurable)\r\n-For these N results, use ChatGPT to assess the quality of the data on 1-10. Results that show a low score are removed\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI think this will make the connection to web browsing incredibly more powerful, and also save on API calls because there will be less in depth analysis of low quality data.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3029/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3029/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
