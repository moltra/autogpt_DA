I an see that it wrtitten some intermediate work and i would have liked to have seen tat data so that the 20 minutes or so wasn't wasted but that data was deleted along with the container on termination.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3483/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3483/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
