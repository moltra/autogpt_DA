Would you like me to return to being javascript-developer-GPT?\r\nContinue with the last settings?\r\nName:  javascript-developer-GPT\r\nRole:  an ai that codes\r\nGoals: ['write code for javascript', 'create a javascript file', 'run a request animation frame and print out +1 on a variable', 'return a print for every time there is 1000 added', 'return a print for every time there is 2000 added']\r\nContinue (y/n): y\r\nUsing memory of type:  LocalCache\r\nUsing Browser:  chrome\r\n THOUGHTS:  I will start by writing the code for javascript and creating a javascript file. Then I will use the request animation frame to print out +1 on a variable. I will set up a condition to return a print for every time there is 1000 added and another print for every time there is 2000 added.\r\nREASONING:  I will start by breaking down the task into smaller steps and then executing each step in order. This will ensure that I am able to complete the task efficiently and without any errors.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Write the code for javascript\r\n-  Create a javascript file\r\n-  Use the request animation frame to print out +1 on a variable\r\n-  Set up a condition to return a print for every time there is 1000 added\r\n-  Set up a condition to return a print for every time there is 2000 added\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to ensure that I am writing clean and efficient code. I should also test my code thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\r\n\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\ndo_something \r\n\r\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n#\r\njavascript-developer-GPT is: an ai that codes\r\nGoal 1: write code for javascript\r\nGoal 2: create a javascript file\r\nGoal 3: run a request animation frame and print out +1 on a variable\r\nGoal 4: return a print for every time there is 1000 added\r\nGoal 5: return a print for every time there is 2000 added\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## branch\r\nmaster\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2023/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 4, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2023/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
