Currently, the commands are hardcoded, making it difficult to customize the system to suit specific needs.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I propose rewriting the command system as plugins. Each command will be implemented as a separate plugin that can be added or disabled as needed. This will provide a modular approach to managing commands, allowing users to easily add new commands and share them with other users and disable default commands that are not required/desired for a given project.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\n- Flexibility: The ability to add new commands without modifying the core codebase. This will allow us to easily extend the functionality of our AI-Self-Prompting-System and adapt it to changing requirements.\r\n- Customization: The ability to disable default commands that are not relevant to our project. This will help us streamline the system and make it more tailored to our specific use case.\r\n- Scalability: The plugin-based architecture will provide a scalable and maintainable way to manage commands as our project grows and evolves over time.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, my primary motivation is to replace the google search API with the reddit API, as google got progressively worse over the years and these days google primarily delivers good results once you add reddit to your search.
