While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThe double quotes after the first triple quote should be removed\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2991/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2991/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
