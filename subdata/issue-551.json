While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThere were a few TODO comments in main.py and chat.py requesting parameters like temperature and token limit to be easily adjustable and not hard-coded. This PR adds those settings into the setup wizard at the start of the script. Users may still elect to keep the defaults.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n`ai_config.py` has 2 new parameters: `ai_temperature` and `ai_token_limit`. The file is updated to save/load them to/from the file and sets defaults if the constructor does not receive them. Defaults for them are stored in an instance dictionary in AIConfig class and can be easily adjusted if necessary.\r\nThe setup wizard in `main.py` is modified to allow those parameters to be set by the user. `construct_prompt()` is renamed to `load_model_config()` and is modified to return the AIConfig object. Prompt construction is moved to the main body. \r\n`chat_with_ai` in `chat.py` is modified to receive `AIConfig` as a parameter instead of `token_limit`. This allows passing temperature and token limit to be passed together. The body is modified accordingly to use those values.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nAll method documentation comments were adjusted to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe functionality of the AutoGPT was not modified, so the tests only included the setup process with different inputs. Defaulting, saving/loading AI parameters, and running the model after setup was thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [V] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [V] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [V] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [V] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [V] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/916/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/916/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
