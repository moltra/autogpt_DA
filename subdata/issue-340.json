Meanwhile, it was scraping, it got some nonsensical code and it decided to write a python function to validate the story. Knowing that it is ridiculous I decided to stop the execution as it was running for quite a long. So I wanted to ask if is there a plan to add support for reader mode in chrome to back the process of scraping data. I was using MilvusMemory in Docker container as the vector database. I have attached the output in the examples section.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n[activity.txt](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/files/11250987/activity.txt)\r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nMy motivation for requesting this feature is to improve the data scraping process of AutoGPT, which is a tool that I use for various tasks. I have encountered some problems with AutoGPT when it tries to scrape data from web pages that are not reader-friendly, such as pages with ads, distractions or incorrectly coded websites. This affects the quality and accuracy of the results that AutoGPT produces, and sometimes it even causes the tool to misfunction and write irrelevant code.\r\n\r\nFor example, I recently asked AutoGPT to generate a story based on the goal of StorytellerGPT, which is to fact-check the story before giving it to me. However, while it was scraping data from a web page, it encountered an improperly coded site. Instead of ignoring it, AutoGPT decided to write a python function to validate the story, which was obviously ridiculous and unnecessary. I had to stop the execution as it was running for too long and wasting resources. I have attached the output in the examples section.\r\n\r\nThis is why I would like to ask if there is a plan to add support for reader mode in Chrome to back the process of scraping data. Reader mode is a feature that removes clutter, ads and distractions from web pages and presents them in a simple and clean format . This would make it easier for AutoGPT to extract relevant information from web pages and generate better results. It would also save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary data and code.\r\n\r\nI think this feature would be useful for many other users who use AutoGPT or similar tools for content creation or research purposes. It would enhance the performance and reliability of these tools and provide a better user experience. I hope you will consider adding this feature in the future.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2181/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2181/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
