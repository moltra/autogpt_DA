However, neither spawned agent knows anything about midjourney or what goes into a prompt even though these topics were researched and saved to memory beforehand.\r\n\r\n## Assistant Specification\r\n\r\nHere's the assistant I created:\r\n\r\n**AI Name**: Midjourney Prompt Master\r\n\r\n**Midjourney Prompt Master is**: An AI that spawns and trains agents in order to make the best midjourney prompts.\r\n\r\n### Goals\r\n\r\n1. Research midjourney documentation and save information about prompt generation and parameters to memory. Only use Midjourney v5 for research.\r\n2. Research what creates a good midjourney prompt. Pay special attention to camera, lighting, and style.\r\n3. Spawn an agent that creates midjourney prompts. Before asking it to perform any tasks, train it on what makes a good midjourney prompt by using information stored in memory or on disk about midjourney.\r\n4. Spawn another agent that critiques the first agent's prompts and generates new prompts based on the critique. Before asking it to perform any tasks, train it on what makes a good midjourney prompt by using information stored in memory or on disk about midjourney.\r\n5. Save the prompts, critiques, and new prompts to a file.\r\n\r\n## Auto GPT Steps\r\n\r\n> NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = google ARGUMENTS = {'input': 'Midjourney v5 documentation'}\r\n\r\n> NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = browse_website ARGUMENTS = {'url': 'https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/quick-start', 'question': 'What makes a good midjourney prompt?'}\r\n\r\n## Spawning the Agent\r\n\r\n> THOUGHTS:  I should spawn an agent that creates midjourney prompts and train it on what makes a good midjourney prompt.

First response: The midjourney prompt generated by the midjourney_prompt_agent is: \"As the sun set behind the mountains, the group realized they were lost. They had to find shelter before nightfall.\" While this prompt sets up a potentially interesting situation, it is quite generic and lacks specificity. It doesn't give much information about the characters or their motivations, and it doesn't provide any unique or unexpected elements to the story. A new prompt could be: \"As the last rays of sunlight disappeared, the group of hikers stumbled upon an abandoned cabin in the woods. But as they settled in for the night, they began to realize that they were not alone.\" This prompt adds more intrigue and suspense to the story, as well as providing a specific setting and potential conflict. It also leaves room for the characters to be developed and for unexpected twists to occur.**\r\n\r\n> Aborted!\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\n\"Valid\" prompt examples\r\n\r\nold man with a messy beard and messy hair, smoking a pipe, wearing a kangol hat, facing the camera, minimalistic --ar 4:6 --v 5\r\n\r\nskeleton wearing a trench coat  --ar 16:9 --v 5\r\n\r\nblue frog wearing a tophat, minimalist --ar 4:6 --v 5\r\n\r\nmad scientist frog at a computer, lighting type: dreamlike, messy hair, --ar 6:9 --v 5\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nI'd like to test the AGI approach of creating specialized agents to perform tasks and critique one another", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2944/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2944/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
