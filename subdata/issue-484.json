Additionally the try-except statement includes too much code\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- added reduce_dataset() to trim down memories and msg_history in a cleaner way\r\n- moved much of the chat_with_ai code outside of the try-except as it doesnt reach out to openai, and cannot raise a rate limiting error. the try block now encompases ONLY the reachout.\r\n- reworked generate_context to only return the context, not a bunch of other meta vars\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\ninline comments. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nran before and after with same yaml files. ensured the loop didnt break and that prompts were acting on the new information from the last run\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
