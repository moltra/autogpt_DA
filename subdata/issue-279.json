It does successfully execute the create-react-app command locally and those initial files get created.

You can see in the logs where it does successfully run the local command, but after that no commands are run and the Roster.js file that it says its creating is never created.\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nIt should write the new source files to disk\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\nCreate a frontend-only react app called called baseball-coach-helper that allows a coach to create their roster with controls for adding one player at a time to the list of players. Each player row should have a name and checkboxes for the positions \"P\", \"C\", \"1B\", \"2B\", \"3B\", \"SS\", and \"Outfield\" indicating whether that player can play those positions. The \"2B\", \"3B\", \"SS\", and \"Outfield\" checkboxes should be checked by default and the others should not. There should be a button to add another player the roster and existing players should all be editable. There should also be a button to delete a player from the roster. \r\n\r\nThere should be another component for defining the following configuration restraints: rotate the pitcher each inning, no player plays the outfield two innings in a row, rotate the catcher each inning if possible, rotate the other positions as much as possible, play 4 outfielders. The play 4 outfielders constraint should only be allowed if there are 4 or more players in the roster.\r\n\r\nHave another component that asks for the number of innings in the game and has a button that uses the names in the roster to generate a randomized batting order as well as a set of defensive assignments that respect as many of the constraints as possible. If its not possible to meet the \"No player plays the outfield two innings in a row\" constraint then you should relax that constraint when necessary to assign all the positions. If there are only 8 players, the outfield assignments consist of Left-Center Field (\"LCF\") and Right-Center Field (\"RCF\"). If there are 9 players there should be three outfielders (\"LF\", \"CF\", \"RF\") and if there are 10 players are more, give the coach an optional constraint to play 4 outfielders (\"LF\", \"LCF\", \"RCF\", \"RF\"). Display the batting order and defensive positions for each inning in tabular format.\r\n\r\nMake sure that the roster list, player position configurations, and defensive configuration constraints are saved into the browser\u2019s localstorage. There should also be a button to clear all the data from localstorage and start the page fresh.\r\n\r\nWrite out all the code for this application to disk, then generate a set of test cases for this website and run the test cases to prove the website works correctly.\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\n\n```log\r\n THOUGHTS:  I think the first task is to create a frontend-only react app called baseball-coach-helper.
