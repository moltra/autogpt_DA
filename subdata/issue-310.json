While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n#### 1. AIConfig and Prompt two classes has interdependence.\r\nThe construct_prompt function in prompt.py is to call the construct_full_prompt function of the AlConfig object,\r\nAnd the construct_full_prompt function needs to call the get_prompt function in prompt.py.\r\n\r\n#### 2. variable assignment\r\nI saw the code in the script of cli.py (called __main__.py yesterday), as follows:\r\n```\r\n        ai_name = \"\"\r\n\t\r\n        other code ......\t\r\n        \r\n        agent = Agent(\r\n            ai_name=ai_name,\r\n            memory=memory,\r\n            full_message_history=full_message_history,\r\n```\r\nWhere is the value of the ai_name variable obtained, it cannot be seen here.\r\n\r\nSo need Optimizing Responsibilities of Class Objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nOptimizing Responsibilities of Class Objects:\r\nAIConfig only config, not generate prompt.\r\nPrompt is responsible generate prompt.\r\nSetup script is responsible to get AIConfig (either from user input or from ai_settings_file).\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.
