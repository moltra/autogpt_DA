After giving feedback, the context and feedback could be stored in long term memory to help AutoGPT make the right decision immediately next time, without the need to provide feedback again.\r\n\r\nNote that this is most beneficial, if memory is persistent - as far as I understood, that is not the case right now(?)\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nI read in another issue that AutoGPT wanted to clone its own repo github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT but ended up finding and cloning GPT-2.\r\nHuman feedback could be: When I talk about AutoGPT i mean github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.\r\nOn a future run, AutoGPt would know, that GPT-2 is not AutoGPT and would not make the same mistake again.\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nautonomous learning of AutoGPT or at least learning from mistakes.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1377/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 5, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1377/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
