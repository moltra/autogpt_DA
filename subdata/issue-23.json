While this normally would not be a problem I have encountered some hiccups, unreadable pdf files for example. \r\n\r\nMy ask boils down to this and please do give your feedback on this:\r\n\r\nCan we either create a plug in or function in the master/stable itself that organizes its workspace?\r\nI must have shot a few 100$ in tokens through several copies of Auto-GPT creating vast libraries that I had to organize.
