This feature will enable Auto-GPT to resume work more efficiently when stopped, by allowing it to load, update, and clear the chat history file.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Implemented chat_history utility functions to handle chat history file operations (load, update, and clear).\r\n- Modified the main chat loop to save chat history to a file.\r\n- Modified initialization to load chat_history from file.\r\n- Added a command-line option to customize the chat history file used.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe new functionality has been documented through in-code comments.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n- Tested the functionality with various chat scenarios, including normal conversations and edge cases.\r\n- Ensured proper file creation and deletion when user chooses not to continue with the last created agent\r\n- Tested the chat history loading and updating process to verify correctness.\r\n- Validated the performance impact of the new functionality, confirming that it does not introduce significant overhead.\r\n\r\nPR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2530/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2530/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
