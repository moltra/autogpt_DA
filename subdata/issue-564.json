Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->\r\n\r\nThe aim of this PR is to make the use of Redis Stack beginner friendly and help developers get consistent results.\r\nDevelopers and curious people can access RedisInsight at  http://localhost:8001/ to see the interaction between Auto-GPT and Redis caching engine.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the changes made in this pull request. Be specific and detailed. -->\r\n\r\nMade it easier to use Redis by providing the steps in the updated documentation.\r\nConsistent build, configuration and testing using a docker-compose.yml type of configuration.\r\nEasy start of the Docker container by using a shell script.\r\nEasier debugging and tracing by using Redis Stack with built-in RedisInsight for development cycles.\r\nBetter security by enabling an access password for \"Production Ready\".\r\n \r\n- Updated README.md with a Docker for Linux.\r\n- Added the Docker Compose file as `docker_redis.yml`\r\n- Added a shell script to make it easy to start the container with `start_redis_docker.sh`\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->\r\n\r\nConfiguration validation with `docker-compose -f docker_redis.yml config` on:\r\n- Fedora Linux 37 with Docker version 23.0.3, build 3e7cbfd and Docker Compose version v2.17.2.\r\n- Third party confirmation of correct build on Windows 11 with Docker Desktop 4.18.0 and Docker Compose version v2.17.2.\r\nMultiple build cycles with `docker system prune -a` to eliminate any image conflicts potential\r\n\r\nSuccessful configuration and built of a Docker Stack image and confirmed:\r\n- .env has the correct Redis configuration\r\n- Running Auto-GPT reports \u201cUsing memory of type: RedisMemory\u201d\r\n- Checking http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser and confirming the CPU, Total Memory, Total Keys and Connected Clients all report positive non-zero values.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Change Safety\r\n\r\n- [x] I have added tests to cover my changes\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/605/reactions", "total_count": 6, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 3, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 1}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/605/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
