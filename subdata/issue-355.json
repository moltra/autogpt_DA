While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nProvide a ubiquitous human-machine challenge module to ensure that crawlers can access deep information on the Internet in a concurrent state.\r\n\r\nThe related kits run based on the Selenium or Playwright. We can launch a headless browser that escapes human-machine validation, or beat the challenge at the source level (sync / async mode).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nFor now, all the code is done only in `autogpt/commands/captchas`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThe following is the expected functionality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Image to Text\r\n- [x] [hCaptcha [general]](https://accounts.hcaptcha.com/demo)\r\n- [x] [reCaptcha v2 [audio/img]](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo)\r\n- [ ] [reCaptcha v3](https://recaptcha-demo.appspot.com/)\r\n- [ ] [Turnstile](https://www.cloudflare.com/zh-cn/products/turnstile/)\r\n- [x] [GeeTest](https://www.geetest.com/show)\r\n- [ ] [163dun](https://dun.163.com/trial/inference)\r\n- [ ] [FunCaptcha](https://api.funcaptcha.com/tile-game-lite-mode/fc/api/nojs/?pkey=69A21A01-CC7B-B9C6-0F9A-E7FA06677FFC&lang=zh)\r\n- [ ] [Epic TalonService](https://talon-website-prod.ak.epicgames.com/)\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.
