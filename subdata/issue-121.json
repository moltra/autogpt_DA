SSH is the best way to do this. I will then use the package manager to update the packages.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  SSH into the server\r\n-  Use the package manager to update the packages\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to ensure that I am using the correct package manager for the Arch distro.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_shell ARGUMENTS = {'command_line': 'ssh 1.1.1.1'}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\nExecuting command 'ssh 1.1.1.1' in working directory '/home/ben/.local/src/Auto-GPT/auto_gpt_workspace'\r\n```\r\n\r\n(ip address changed for description)\n\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\n\nI see that the Auto-GPT agent successfully SSHs into the server:\r\n\r\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1092275629602394184/1099748068351553656/image.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the agent hangs and will not continue. The last line of the prompt above is where it gets stuck. Ctrl+c does not affect the session, I have to force close the terminal.\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nSuccessfully recognizes it has SSH'd into the server, and continues with the next goal.\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n_No response_\n\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\n\n```log\r\n2023-04-27 11:52:33,828 INFO Welcome back!
