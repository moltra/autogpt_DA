the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThe current Dockerfile generates a large amount of unneeded layers containing copies of the APT cache at build time.  \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nA GPT model advised to modify the Dockerfile like this. ;-)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThis is what the GPT model had to say about its changes:\r\n\r\nIn this new version, we've merged all installation steps in a single `RUN` command. This way, we can reduce the number of layers in the image and avoid bloating it unnecessarily. We first install all the dependencies except Chromium and Firefox-ESR. After that, we add the Google repository key and repository to the sources list, and then we update the package lists again and install Chromium and Firefox-ESR. We've added a clean step to remove the apt cache and other unused files, reducing the size of the resulting layer.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] n/a I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] n/a I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2821/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2821/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
