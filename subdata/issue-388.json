The summary must be detailed and contains all subtilities required. Then each summary must be saved in a file located in the folder \"./python_sumary\". \r\nGoal 2: \r\nUsing memory of type:  LocalCache\r\nUsing Browser:  chrome\r\n THOUGHTS:  Based on your goal to create detailed summaries of each file in the python_doc directory, you can start by listing the contents of the directory using the 'search_files' command. This will allow you to see all the files in the directory and their file paths. You can use this information to loop through each file, read its contents, and write a summary to a new file in the python_summary directory. You can use the 'read_file' command to read the contents of a file, the 'write_to_file' command to write the summary to a new file, and the 'delete_file' command to delete any files in the python_summary directory that you determine need to be replaced with updated summaries.\r\nREASONING:  Listing the contents of the directory and looping through each file programmatically will save time compared to manually opening and closing each file. Creating new files in the python_summary directory and deleting old ones will ensure the summaries are always up to date.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Use the 'search_files' command to list the contents of the python_doc directory\r\n-  Loop through each file listed and use the 'read_file' command to read each file's contents\r\n-  Use the contents of each file to write a summary using the 'write_to_file' command in a new file in the python_summary directory\r\n-  Use the 'delete_file' command to delete files in the python_summary directory that need to be replaced\r\nCRITICISM:  Make sure to write high-quality summaries that will be helpful to other developers. Consider ways to be concise but comprehensive in your summaries. Also, consider using a more sophisticated summarization algorithm or tool to improve the quality of your summaries.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nApparently json was fixed. \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = search_files ARGUMENTS = {'directory': './python_doc/'}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\nInput:Let's do 5 files to begin, if a file is over 4000 characters including spaces , split the file in two.\r\nSYSTEM:  Human feedback: Let's do 5 files to begin, if a file is over 4000 characters including spaces , split the file in two.\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI. Try changing it up slightly.\r\nFailed to fix AI output, telling the AI.  \r\nError: Invalid JSON\r\n  Understood. Here is a modified plan to summarize the python_doc files:\r\n\r\n1. Use the 'search_files' command to list the contents of the python_doc directory.\r\n2. Loop through each of the first five files listed.\r\n3. Use the 'read_file' command to read each file's contents.\r\n4. If a file is over 4000 characters including spaces, split it in two by using the 'write_to_file' command to write the first 4000 characters to a new file in the python_summary directory and then using the 'append_to_file' command to add the remaining characters to the same file.\r\n5. Otherwise, write a summary of each file's contents using the 'write_to_file' command in a new file in the python_summary directory.\r\n6. Be sure to review each summary for quality before moving on to the next file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the plan above only summarizes the first five files in the python_doc directory. If you would like to summarize more files, simply modify step 2 to loop through a different number of files.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nError: Invalid JSON, setting it to empty JSON now.\r\n  \r\n THOUGHTS:  None\r\nREASONING:  None\r\nCRITICISM:  None\r\nSPEAK:  None\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nError: Invalid JSON, setting it to empty JSON now.\r\n  \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = Error: ARGUMENTS = 'dict' object has no attribute 'replace'\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\nInput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1894/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1894/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "reopened"}
