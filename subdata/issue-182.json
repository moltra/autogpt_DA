Regardless, in many cases, a list of otherwise iterable items is squished into a single prompt instead of breaking them up.\r\n\r\nI propose recognizing the development parlance \"For Each\" to specifically be a request for list iteration, perhaps with independent agents. In a perfect world, the agents could run in parallel, but I realize that this hopeful wish has major implications, haha. \r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n```\r\nGoal 1: Identify from the client's website, https://website.com/, the most important services\r\nGoal 2: For each service, create and save to a file a long-form description of the service, including the benefits of the service\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, what is returned is a short description of each service jammed into a single ChatGPT response, one file saved, etc.\r\nSimilarly, if there are many services, then the result is many short descriptions in one response.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nExample uses which run into the list iteration issue are common in the digital marketing space, as an agency owner looking to streamline our ideation needs, here are some examples:\r\n\r\n- Key service identification from websites, as shown above.\r\n- From key services, identification of target keywords on a per-service basis\r\n- Same, but identification of missing content pages, given target keywords.\r\n- The creation of ad copy (for example, Google Ads, \"Responsive Search Ads\" require sets of 15 advertising headlines of 30 characters or less and four descriptions of 90 characters or less, each!\r\n- Most social content requires quantities of content, not just one post, iterating over content blocks to, for example, add keywords, or extract ideas, etc.\r\n\r\nBasically, everything in my vertical requires iteration, and AutoGPT would benefit from a specific function to facilitate it!\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat work folks!\r\n\r\n*Edit: Grammar", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3072/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3072/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
