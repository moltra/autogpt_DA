I encountered this problem when trying to get Speech Mode to work.\n\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\n\nI got the error ERROR: Failed building wheel for PyGObject\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nNo errors and the Python run script `python -m autogpt --speak` works.\r\n\r\nAlso, the setup guide in the README needs updating. On my, machine Python is mapped to the `python3` command and I use `pip3` so none of the commands would work. Not every developer would be aware of this issue.\r\n\r\nI was able to debug the errors I had thanks to ChatGPT so maybe the README can be updated with the solution so that other people can use it as well --> https://twitter.com/andrewbaisden/status/1646930563172012033?s=20\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\n# Paste your prompt here\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
