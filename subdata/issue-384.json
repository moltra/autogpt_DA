The goal is to make it extremely easy to connect large language models to a large variety of knowledge sources. These are general-purpose utilities that are meant to be used in [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index/tree/main/gpt_index) (e.g. when building a index) and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) (e.g. when building different tools an agent can use). For example, there are loaders to parse Google Docs, SQL Databases, PDF files, PowerPoints, Notion, Slack, Obsidian, and many more. Note that because different loaders produce the same types of Documents, you can easily use them together in the same index.\r\nThese general-purpose loaders are designed to be used as a way to load data into [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index/tree/main/gpt_index) and/or subsequently used as a Tool in a [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) Agent. You can use them with download_loader from LlamaIndex in a single line of code! \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nExamples of LLAMA-Index Loaders: [https://llamahub.ai/](https://llamahub.ai/)\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI believe that the combination of Auto-GPT with LLAMA-Index will be explosive!", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931/reactions", "total_count": 11, "+1": 11, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
