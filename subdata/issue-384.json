While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses the need to provide an alternative local memory storage solution for Auto-GPT. Annoy is a fast and efficient local vector database that provides lower-latency access to embeddings compared to cloud-based solutions. By integrating Annoy as a memory backend, users can benefit from improved performance without relying on external services.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n    1. Added Annoy as an optional memory backend to the project.\r\n    2. Created a new AnnoyMemory class that implements the required methods for memory storage and retrieval.\r\n    3. Modified the initialization and configuration of the project to support the Annoy backend.\r\n    4. Updated the README.md file with instructions on how to install Annoy and configure it as the memory backend.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n    1. In-code comments have been added to describe the purpose and functionality of the new AnnoyMemory class.\r\n    2. The README.md file has been updated with clear instructions on how to set up and use Annoy as the memory backend, including how to install Annoy and configure the necessary environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nTo test the functionality of the AnnoyMemory implementation, the following steps were performed:\r\n\r\n    1. Updated the configuration in the .env file to use the Annoy backend by setting MEMORY_BACKEND=annoy and adding the appropriate paths for ANNOY_INDEX_FILE and ANNOY_METADATA_FILE.\r\n    2. Ran the Auto-GPT application to ensure that the Annoy backend was being utilized and that it was properly loading, storing, and retrieving data.\r\n    3. Performed multiple test runs with different inputs, queries, and configurations to ensure that AnnoyMemory was functioning as expected and without errors.\r\n    4. Additionally, executed the provided unittests to verify the correctness of the AnnoyMemory implementation and its methods.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1996/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1996/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
