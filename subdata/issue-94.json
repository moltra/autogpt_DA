The API endpoints will return data in JSON format for easier manipulation and integration with other modules or parts of the application. After implementing the APIs, I will test them thoroughly and make any necessary changes for optimal performance.\r\n2023-04-30 06:46:03,220 INFO REASONING: Using a web framework such as Flask makes it easier to implement complex REST APIs for data manipulation in a concise way. The framework provides many built-in functions that will reduce the amount of boilerplate code I need to write for these endpoints. After thoroughly testing the APIs, I can be sure that they will work optimally with the rest of the application.\r\n2023-04-30 06:46:04,532 INFO PLAN: \r\n2023-04-30 06:46:04,580 INFO -  Use Flask to implement the necessary APIs for CRUD operations on articles.\\\\n- Test the APIs and make any necessary changes for optimal performance.\r\n2023-04-30 06:46:05,255 INFO CRITICISM: I need to make sure that the APIs are resistant to errors and that they can handle a significant amount of data.
