Ideally we can set these via command line and directly enter execution.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded command line params for the above, and then passed them down to the configurator in a way that allows you to specify ANY of them (while prompting for the rest if necessary). Command line overrides will override any ai settings files if both are provided, by design.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nUpdated comments and documented tests - TODO update main docs\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCreated new unit tests and manually ran a couple prompts\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3250/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3250/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
