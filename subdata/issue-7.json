Especially when testing a lot, I found that setting the goals fixed in the .env file has pro's as I am 100% sure they are set according to plan. The ability to either prepend or append them and the overrule the ai_sttings.yaml for the goals are also included.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe ability to either prepend or append GOALS and to overrule the ai_settings.yaml are included in this change.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIn-code comments are at the \"load\" function in ai_config.py and documentation with the settings in the .env.template file.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI tested this by adding goals, ai_name and role in the env file and launch auto-GPT, it either prepends/appends the goals and respects the goals from the ai_settings.yaml file. Or when ENV_GOALS_ONLY=True it ignores the goals from the ai_settings.yaml and only uses the goals as set in the .env file.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3711/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3711/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
