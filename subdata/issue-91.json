But not in the allowlist... Load? (y/n):`\r\n\r\nThese prompts don't feel necessary and they create more than one path for how things work which can be confusing.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nI could see fixing this two ways:\r\n\r\n1. Remove these prompts completely. If a plugin is not in ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS, it won't run.\r\n2. Add a way to disable these prompts or have `--skip-reprompt` also skip these prompts.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is the first option is easier to implement (removes code) and makes for a very deterministic system where the plugins enabled run and those which are not enabled do not.\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI think the plugins could be more deterministic an easier to understand what is going on.\r\n\r\nScenarios:\r\n- As a new user, If I don't want certain plugins to run, I don't put them in the allowed list. Why am I being asked to run them? Should I run them? Did I do something wrong? ;-)\r\n- As an experienced user, stop asking me to run things I've not enabled.
