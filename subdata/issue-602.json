See https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/25#issuecomment-1499531177\r\n\r\nLocal models and embeddings offer better privacy, lower costs, and enable new uses, like Auto-GPT experiments in private/air-gapped networks. To get these benefits, we should add local (offline) embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nA version of ooba's text-generation-webui, called [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory), has done this using zarr and Numpy. Check [wawawario2/long_term_memory#how-it-works-behind-the-scenes](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory#how-it-works-behind-the-scenes)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5949853/230487779-d6748718-8ee0-49b6-9026-6758b48deaae.png)\r\n\r\nThough the Auto-GPT fork uses ooba's webui API for local models, the long_term_memory project is closely tied to ooba's UI. We mention it only as a reference. We need to create a similar setup in Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\n1. Better Privacy: Local embeddings keep user data on their devices or networks, avoiding the risk of online data breaches.\r\n2. Lower Costs: Users save money on cloud storage, bandwidth, and processing power when they use local embeddings.\r\n3. Offline Use: Auto-GPT can work in offline environments or areas with limited internet, like secure facilities or remote research stations.\r\n4. Customization: Users can create and manage their own embeddings for better model performance and results.\r\n5. Faster Response: Local embeddings can speed up response times since data doesn't need to travel to remote servers.\r\n\r\nBy adding local embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT, users get more control, flexibility, and benefits like privacy, cost savings, and accessibility.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/347/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/347/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
