Also @pi is of great help there.\r\n\r\nPresently, there is a flow of low-quality reports, where people are having various support issues or have bad prompts so that AutoGPT doesn't work for them. We need someone to sort those out and help those people with their problems.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that you can work as a T1 we can give you labeling permissions. It usually takes a day.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nIs possible execute auto-gpt on Debian 11? #2141 - clearly a support question\r\nHow can I fix this and proceed? #2073 - it clearly comes from someone who has never used a tracker before\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are already people working on sorting the issues out, but they are high-class engineers so it's not a good idea to waste their effort on easy tasks. This is a common issue in technical support, and it's solved by having support tiers, where T1 support faces all the support traffic, and escalates the issues they cannot solve to T2. And T2 escalates to T3 which is commonly core developers.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n- T1 labels the support requests as such using GitHub labels and helps the persons with their (relatively simple) problems\r\n- T2 works on the remaining unlabeled requests to get bug reports and/or ask the authors to improve their reports (we already have it staffed but more persons are welcome), and to notify T3 of urgent problems, such as bugs in stable or recently introduced bugs in master\r\n- T3 will be just our `contributors` group in Discord.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2144/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
