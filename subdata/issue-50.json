While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nThe browse_website AutoGPT command has had a harmless but ugly bug for a while now: It kept adding a reference to the Selenium Driver in the result.\r\n\r\nExample (look at the last line)\r\n`\r\nSystem: Command browse_website returned: (\"Answer gathered from website: The text does not provide information on the pros and cons of commercially available cherry cultivars. However, it does mention two varieties of sweet cherries, Dark Sweet Cherries and Rainier Cherry, and provides information on their nutrient content claims and health claims. The text also states that sweet cherries are available fresh, frozen, canned, and dried for good nutrition and convenience. If selecting fresh cherries, it is recommended to choose firm, red cherries with stems attached and to avoid soft or shriveled cherries. \\n \\n Links: ['Fruits & Veggies (https://fruitsandveggies.org/fruits-and-veggies/)', 'F&V Inspo (https://fruitsandveggies.org/series/)', 'Recipes (https://fruitsandveggies.org/recipes/)', 'Expert Advice (https://fruitsandveggies.org/expert-advice)', 'Contributors (https://fruitsandveggies.org/contributors/)']\", <selenium.webdriver.chrome.webdriver.WebDriver (session=\"3ba34c5bb2d35f19d1c9777620807894\")>)`\r\n\r\nNot really a big problem, but it does add some needless noise into AutoGPT's memory, and looks ugly too.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nWill not return the Selenium driver object along with the results of the browsing.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nTested by browsing with and without this change.

If you have, check the appropriate box.
