This feature will help AUTO-GPT become more efficient at performing simple and common tasks, thus accelerating the overall development of the software.\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature includes a centralized database for storing task logs and paths, clear criteria for determining the \"commonality\" of a task, and a mechanism for continuous learning and improvement based on user feedback and path performance. Additionally, the feature ensures that there is sufficient user data for a given task before using shared information to execute the task. This shared database will enable further analysis of the most efficient paths and create variations of code that could lead to more effective results.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n``\r\n`function logTaskCompletion(task, efficiency, additionalInfo) {\r\n    // Log the task completion with relevant information\r\n    log = createLog(task, efficiency, additionalInfo)\r\n    \r\n    // Assign a score based on efficiency\r\n    score = calculateScore(efficiency)\r\n    \r\n    // Save the log to the centralized database\r\n    saveLogToDatabase(log, score)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isTaskCommon(task) {\r\n    // Check if the task meets the criteria for being \"common\"\r\n    if (taskFrequency(task) > COMMON_THRESHOLD) {\r\n        return true\r\n    }\r\n    return false\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction hasSufficientData(task) {\r\n    // Check if there are enough user data for the task\r\n    if (getUserDataCount(task) > MINIMUM_DATA_THRESHOLD) {\r\n        return true\r\n    }\r\n    return false\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction performCommonTask(task) {\r\n    // Identify if the task is common and has sufficient user data\r\n    if (isTaskCommon(task) && hasSufficientData(task)) {\r\n        // Find the best path from the centralized database with the highest score\r\n        bestPath = findBestPathFromDatabase(task)\r\n        \r\n        // Execute the task using the best path\r\n        executeTaskUsingPath(task, bestPath)\r\n    } else {\r\n        // Perform the task using AUTO-GPT's standard approach\r\n        executeTask(task)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction updateCommonActionLibrary() {\r\n    // Update the centralized database with new learning and improvements\r\n    // based on user feedback and path performance\r\n    applyMachineLearningAndOptimization()\r\n}\r\n``\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation behind this feature request is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AUTO-GPT in executing simple and common tasks. By leveraging shared information between users, AUTO-GPT can learn and adapt more quickly, resulting in better performance and faster task completion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the proposed feature includes a centralized database, clear criteria for determining the \"commonality\" of a task, and a mechanism for continuous learning and improvement based on user feedback and path performance. The additional validation of having sufficient user data for a given task ensures that the shared information used to execute tasks is effective and reliable.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this shared database will facilitate the analysis of highly efficient paths compared to less efficient ones, and create variations of code that could lead to more effective results. In conclusion, I believe that shared information has immense short-term potential to improve the efficiency of frequent simple tasks and accelerate self-development by utilizing data from the growing number of users. I believe The effect will be exponential and has the potential to greatly contribute to the accomplishment of an advance AGI. \r\n\r\n\r\nI used chat-GPT to quickly lay my tought with the above text but it is a good overview of what i had in mind, \r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1749/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1749/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
