You have to do it each run.\r\nOn the other hand, if we just skip the memory reset, it will bloat really fast, considering that an agent can make mistakes, take false assumptions, etc.\r\n\r\nSo my idea here is to add one more memory index, that will persist between runs, and will be read-only for an agent.\r\nThis way we will be able to keep the data that we want to ingest to each run, without littering it with possibly useless information.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nFor example you may want to feed an agent with some documentation about specific service (like API specs) ask it to write a client library in various languages.\r\nFor each language it will search for various info like syntax, packaging, etc, but the API specs will remain the same each time.\r\nSo you want to keep the API specs, but do not want to mix packaging in Python and packaging in Go.\r\nWith the current implementation you will have to ingest the API specs each run for each language, which will be a waste of resources and time.\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI would like to hear what the community thinks about this?\r\n\r\nIf the idea makes sense, I can make a PR.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3382/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3382/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
