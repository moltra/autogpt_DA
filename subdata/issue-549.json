Or, to make it more flexible perhaps use \"Entrepreneur-GPT\" and then use a sub name to clarify intention or associations such as \"Entrepreneur-GPT_first-run\" or even have an additional prompt asking for subtask name.\r\n\r\nIf this is all just too complex for the current goals or intentions, perhaps a simple command line argument is appropriate of `--clear-memory` instead of having a `WIPE_REDIS_ON_START` within the .env.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if this is clear or if further discussion is needed.\r\n\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nThe goal is to retain or leverage multiple sessions knowledge acquisition in an associative and amplifying way, but while retaining proper context isolated to related \"dives\" into the topic or goal.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/831/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 2}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/831/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
