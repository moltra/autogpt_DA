Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nGeneral discussion among the AI community has been lately expressing concern about alignment, risk and recklessness in recent developments. This intends to alleviate concerns, allowing users to put more trust leaving in AutoGPT on its own.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nThis PR adds a Risk Avoidance (Hybrid) mode, mutually exclusive with Continuous mode and meant to be a midpoint between full-auto and human assisted. When under this mode, an intermediate GPT call will be made to evaluate every command executed. If the calculated risk exceeds a user-defined threshold, execution is paused until the human manually approves it. There are relevant additions made to configuration, both in environment variables (threshold and model to use) and the command-line argument to activate the mode.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nChanges are documented with code comments. I believe them to be sufficient, plus the added behavior is pretty self-descriptive.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI tested the risk avoidance mode by running AutoGPT with the --riskAvoidance flag and several risk thresholds to calibrate its correct behavior. The prompt used to assess risk was thoroughly tested with both gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 through the ChatGPT interface, with what I consider to be success.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\nI have not added tests since the functionality is not testable on its own.\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/934/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/934/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
