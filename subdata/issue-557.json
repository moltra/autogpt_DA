However, based on a suggestion, the knowledge cutoff was directly added to the `prompt.txt` file. This aims to provide metadata to the AI, enhancing its search coordination and thought processes.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nA single line was added on top of `prompt.txt` file. The line added is `Knowledge Cutoff Date: Please remember that your knowledge and information are accurate and up-to-date as of September 2021. Please use this information to better coordinate your searches and thoughts.`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nUnfortunately, no documentation is made.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nNo test was conducted.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not included any \"extra\" small tweaks or changes.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/758/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/758/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
