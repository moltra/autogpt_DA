The volume of a regular tetrahedron with edge length 2m is (2^3)/(6sqrt(2)) m^3, which is approximately 0.4714 m^3\r\n\r\nEverything is correct, except the calculated volume of the tetrahedron. The formula is correct and gives exact the double of the volume, that the system found, that is 0.95 m^3\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\n\"Simple\" calculation needs to be done all the time and without relieable results not much can be achieved.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3412/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3412/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
