This was missed in case of \"redis\", so I added the memory.clear() in case of \"redis\" + init=True.\r\n\r\nWarning: I have not tested it, it just made sense. Request to test if someone can. I do not have the required APIs to test it through.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nmemory should be cleared if init is True. This was missed for Redis.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nFollowing the example of Pinecone, I added the same logic in the Redis branch of if else logic.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe change is small enough and follows the expected logic of the function. Documenting this change is unnecessary.\r\n \r\nAs only atomic changes are allowed, I will make a separate pull request for the function documentation of get_memory\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n> :warning: **UNTESTED CODE CHANGE**\r\nI have not tested the code in anyway. I am just expecting it to work.\r\n\r\nAtm, I do not have API keys to test.\r\nKindly reject the pull request if it doesn't pass the tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1293/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1293/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
