While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nMany times I encountered an agent getting stuck when starting a GUI application like vi or nano via the execute_shell command. Resulting in auto-GPT waiting endlessly until I either killed the command through another terminal session or I had to completely abandon the session with CTRL+C.\r\n\r\nThe GUI applications nano and vi or gedit are unnecessary as auto-GPT has the write_to_file and append_to_file commands to take care of that.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nTo be able to set the disallowed commands, I added the parameter \"DISALLOWED_COMMANDS\" to the .env.template.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIn the .env file you can set the DISALLOWED_COMMANDS, comma separated like DISALLOWED_COMMANDS=nano,vi,gedit\r\n\r\nThe variable DISALLOWED_COMMANDS can contain commands with spaces. The code that checks for disallowed commands isn't designed to handle complex commands with arguments, it's just looking for specific command names in the input string. If we need to handle complex commands, we may need a more sophisticated approach.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested with various goals which might triggered commands that we want to disallow, like nano, vi, gedit.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3707/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3707/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
