In this process, the same sites are returned by Google that provide in some cases no real value. I would appreciate it if such URLs could be manually. This would also help to prevent loops in some cases.\r\n\r\nIn theory, also automatically adding sites to such a list would make sense, but it needs to be used carefully. For automatically adding, a setting could be used e.g. to add sites returning HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nIn some cases, sites are accessed which return a 404 or contain a totally different topic. It makes no sense to try to access such sites again.\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI love Auto-GPT, but I hate to see it running over the same sites again and again, providing no value and costing tokens. It would increase the efficiency and effectivity of Auto-GPT if the usage of a URL blacklist is possible.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3118/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3118/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
