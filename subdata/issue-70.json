Making the voices configurable in .env makes it easy to choose voices without have to edit code.\r\n\r\nThe StreamElements TTS module can be enabled in .env via the USE_SE_TTS setting. Voices can be specified in .env using the SE_VOICE_1, SE_VOICE_2 and SE_VOICE_3 settings. They will default to Emma, Brian and Amy if no settings are specified in .env.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Create a new StreamElementsSpeech class using BrianSpeech as a model. \r\n2. Add support for this new module in say.py\r\n3. Add support to enable module via .env in config.py\r\n\r\n_Note: The new StreamElementsSpeech module essentially replaces the BrianSpeech module, but the BrianSpeech module is not removed by this change._\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nRetained comments copied over from BrianSpeech.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI ran through several different scenarios with speech enabled. Note that I did not test every possible voice.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.
