If anyone has more or less ready solution, I'm capable of implementing it in many different jurisdictions. I'd like to avoid US for the moment, for unfamiliarity of the legal system and @Torantulino not living there, but US/EU/offshore are all possible.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? It will not impose corporate control on the project, as the founder(s) will be in full control of the created entity. I will do a legal consultation on this matter, but I need as much information as possible to tell them so they propose a solution. \n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n[The Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/)\r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nWe need to do something like this to prevent corporate control and/or undermining the project by hiring key contributors, and so on.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/935/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 2, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/935/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
