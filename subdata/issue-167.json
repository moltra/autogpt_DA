While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nPostgresML can be used as an memory backend for Auto-GPT. PostgresML is an open-source machine learning extension to PostgreSQL that enables training and inference on text and tabular data. With PostgresML, you can integrate machine learning models into your PostgreSQL database. In addition, you can use your existing PostgreSQL database as a vector database by generating embeddings from text stored in the database.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n- [Generating LLM embeddings with open source models in PostgresML](https://postgresml.org/blog/generating-llm-embeddings-with-open-source-models-in-postgresml)\r\n- [PostgresML as a Vector Database](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml#vector-database)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- `.env.template` includes a section on PostgresML environment variables\r\n- `autogpt/config/config.py` includes PostgresML configuration\r\n- `autogpt/memory/__init__.py` includes PostgresMLMemory as a supported memory backend\r\n- `autogpt/memory/postgresml.py` A new Python file and a new class called `PostgresMLMemory` developed using `redis` implementation as a reference\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- Each file that has been edited/added has respective inline comments\r\n- Updated `docs/configuration/memory.md` with an additional section on PostgresML installation instructions and `pip` dependencies\r\n- `pip` dependencies for PostgresML are not included in the requirements.txt\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nThese steps are included [in documentation](https://github.com/santiatpml/Auto-GPT/blob/memory-postgresml/docs/configuration/memory.md#postgresml-setup). Rewriting summary here:\r\n\r\n1. Install PostgresML using Docker or spin up a PostgresML cloud database\r\n2. Clone Auto-GPT and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n3. To use PostgresML memory backend: \r\n    - Install libpq-dev : `sudo apt install libpq-dev`\r\n    - `pip install psycopg2` \r\n4. `python -m autogpt -m postgresml` will use PostgresML as memory backend\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n<!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\nI have not added tests related to this PR as this involves additional dependencies like spinning up a PostgresML database and Python packages. I have not seen any tests for redis or pinecone for reference. Happy to add any suggested tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3274/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3274/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
