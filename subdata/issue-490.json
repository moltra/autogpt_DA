This is what happens when it tries to execute the common lisp interpreter 'sbcl':\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Use the `execute_shell` command to start the Lisp interpreter\r\n-  Load the program for word frequency counting as well as the test, using the `load` command\r\n-  Use the `run-tests` command to run the tests and see if there are any errors.\r\n-  Output the results of the tests in JSON format using the `write_to_file` command if they pass\r\nCRITICISM:  None\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nApparently json was fixed. \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_shell ARGUMENTS = {'command_line': 'sbcl'}\r\nExecuting command 'sbcl' in working directory '/app/auto_gpt_workspace'\r\ny -5\r\n\r\nType HELP for debugger help, or (SB-EXT:EXIT) to exit from SBCL.\r\n\r\nrestarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):\r\n  0: [CONTINUE   ] Retry using Y.\r\n  1: [USE-VALUE  ] Use specified value.\r\n  2: [STORE-VALUE] Set specified value and use it.\r\n  3: [ABORT      ] Exit debugger, returning to top level.\r\n\r\n(SB-INT:SIMPLE-EVAL-IN-LEXENV Y #<NULL-LEXENV>)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese last line, beginning with 'Type HELP...' is the output of the Lisp exception handler. I suspect that only STDOUT is sent back to the agent and this is most probalby STDERR.\n\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\n\nShwoing STDERR from executed shell commands to the user instead of sending it to the agent\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nsending STDERR to the agent as well as STDOUT\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\n# please create a common lisp project in the local file system which can read a text file and print the contents in upper case, including at least one test\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1357/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1357/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
