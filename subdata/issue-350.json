While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nOver the past two days, I've been studying Auto GPT and find the idea very innovative, which excites me. I created a project called [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache), which I think would be a suitable memory module for the current project. Based on what I understand, the current memory module primarily relies on the ten most recent message texts. After conducting an embedding operation, a vector search is performed to obtain context information. This enables the OpenAI ChatComplete interface to have context from previous messages and obtain information for the next task. By integrating GPTCache, the process of obtaining context information can be even more customizable. GPTCache offers the following capabilities:\r\n\r\n- The embedding module in GPTCache supports multiple embedding implementations.\r\n- The store module in GPTCache has a useful extension method for vector storage, allowing for better data management, such as eviction and separate storage of scalar and vector data.\r\n- By setting a threshold, the similarity evaluation module in GPTCache can obtain more relevant context information. Setting the threshold to 0 is consistent with other backend methods of the current memory.\r\n\r\nFully utilizing GPTCache would require additional development time, but its capabilities could significantly enhance the functionality and performance of the current memory module. Therefore, I believe it's worth it.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.
