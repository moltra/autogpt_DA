The current language used for speaking commands is a bit clunky, however, and a more natural choice of words would be nice.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Move CommandRegistry.import_commands logic out of main.py and into CommandRegistry.\\_\\_init__ so the registry can be accessed by both main.py and app.py\r\n2. Add get_command_speech() function to app.py to generate wording for a command via its description in the registry, along with a few hard-coded phrases for unregistered commands\r\n3. Call get_command_speech from agent.py instead of using default text\r\n4. Refine some command descriptions for use in speech\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe new get_command_speech function is easy to understand without documentation.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI ran through several different scenarios with speech enabled. Note that I did not test every possible command.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3565/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3565/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
