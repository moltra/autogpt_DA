This change ensures that the script only runs in supported Python versions, improving stability and reliability.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe code has been modified to check for Python 3.10 and above before running the Auto GPT script. If the required version of Python is not detected, an error message is printed to the console.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes have been documented with in-code comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the added code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe changes have been tested on a local machine running Python 3.10 and above. The script was also tested with lower versions of Python to ensure that the error message is displayed when attempting to run Auto GPT.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n - [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n - [x]  I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n - [x]  I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n - [x]  I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n - [x]  I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes.\r\n - [ ]  I have added new test cases to cover the added functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3598/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3598/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
