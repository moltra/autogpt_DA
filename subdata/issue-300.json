The previous implementation had a fixed voice for the second agent, \"Ava (Premium)\", which might not be available on all systems. This PR provides a more dynamic approach to handling macOS TTS voices.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. The MacOSTTS class has been updated to include a `_setup()` method that fetches the available voices on the system and sets up the default and custom voices accordingly.\r\n2. Added a `get_voice_names()` method to the MacOSTTS class to retrieve available voice names on the system.\r\n3. Updated the `_speech()` method in the MacOSTTS class to use voices from the `_voices` list instead of hardcoding voice names.\r\n4. Updated the `.env.template` and `config.py` files to include new environment variables for specifying custom macOS TTS voices.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIn-code comments and descriptions have been added to the MacOSTTS class methods, explaining their purpose, functionality, input arguments, and return values.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Set up the Auto-GPT repository on a macOS system.\r\n2. Configure the `.env` file to enable macOS TTS support and specify custom voices using the provided environment variables.\r\n3. Run the Auto-GPT application and test with various prompts to ensure that the macOS TTS voices are working correctly and switching between different voices as expected.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2489/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2489/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
