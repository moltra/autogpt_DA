You should be able to see all actions in a history. Possibly even be able to call up parameters and then evaluate them with positive \"p\" and \"n\" negative. This evaluation file could then be shared as an extension among different users or in the end even played back to openAi for learning.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nTo improve the software by crowd learning.
