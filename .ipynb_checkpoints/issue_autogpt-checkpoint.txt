‚ö†Ô∏è SUPER-busy repo, please help the volunteer maintainers.
The less time we spend here, the more time we spend building AutoGPT.

Please help us help you:

Does it work on stable branch (https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/tree/stable)?
Does it work on current master (https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/tree/master)?
Search for existing issues, "add comment" is tidier than "new issue"
Ask on our Discord (https://discord.gg/autogpt)

If it's a crash, provide traceback.
