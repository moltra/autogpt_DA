0,"### Background
Windows generally doesn't care about null bytes in paths, but posix systems do.  This alters the behavior of our path sanitization function to make it more platform independent by restricting the use of null bytes on all systems.  The error raised is the same raised by pathlib on posix systems.  I've also expanded the number of null byte representations we check for.

### Changes

- Add an explicit null bytes check to path sanitization.
- Expanded the number of null byte representations checked for.

### Documentation
Comment added explaining the platform specific issues.

### Test Plan
Additional tests added for the function.

Test suite run locally on linux and windows.

"
3,"### Background
Addressing #942:

AutoGPT is hard coded to use fast_llm_model for everything except the write_tests, evaluate_code, and improve_code commands. (see https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/blob/master/scripts/chat.py#L66 for example)

The result is that even if I use --gpt4only, we still see GPT 3.5 being used.

**Steps to reproduce 🕹**
Run python scripts/main.py with OpenAI API key that supports gp4 usage in env and pass --gpt4only as cli arg

**Current behavior 😯**
From #942: AutoGPT is only making use of gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 and text-embedding-ada-002-v2

**Expected behavior 🤔**
AutoGPT should use gpt-4 model if --gpt4only is passed in as cli arg

### Changes
Fix [#942](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/942): Respect --gpt4only, --gpt3only cli args

- Add `cfg.fast_llm_model` to `chat_with_ai` method parameters.
- Remove the hardcoded model in `chat_with_ai` method and `Agent` class
- Add `GPT_4_MODEL` and `GPT_3_MODEL` constants to `configurator.py`.
- Change `--gpt3only` to use `GPT_3_MODEL` not `CFG.fast_llm_model`.
- Change `--gpt4only` to use `GPT_4_MODEL` not `CFG.smart_llm_model`.
- Add tests for `--gpt4only` and `--gpt3only` CLI args

### Documentation
No documentation changes. The docs will finally do what they say.

### Test Plan
- Added test_cli tests to test the behavior

4,"### Background
Sometimes the `get_hyperlinks` function returns too many links which exceed the GPT model's limitations, resulting in an `openai.error.InvalidRequestError`. For example: 
```
openai.error.InvalidRequestError: This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10982 tokens (10982 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.
```

### Changes
Added a `max_links` parameter to the `scrape_links` function  with a default value of 40 to limit the number of links returned.

### Documentation
The changes have been documented in the modified function's docstring.

### Test Plan
The changes have been tested on multiple websites.

### Summary 💡

AutoGPT should be able to parse website elements, as well as directly interact with the website. As of now `web_selenium.py` can only scrape text and links from each page. It should be able to, for instance, scrape buttons and click them, or fields and fill them. Ideally AutoGPT would figure all of this out and write and maintain code that does it. I tried coaxing it to do this without success.

### Examples 🌈

Example goal: find the cheapest round-trip flight from New York to Paris leaving May 1 and returning May 10. Flights should be direct and departing during typical waking hours.

### Motivation 🔦

Better interact with websites, use GUI elements, fill forms, etc."

### Summary 💡

Need the system to be able to read SEC Financial Statements and not be limited because of a token limitation. 

### Examples 🌈

Not limited to token read.

### Motivation 🔦

The SEC Edgar website has a lot of financial data, but the AI is limited to how much it can read. "
15,"### Background
Many issues (https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1891#issuecomment-1519176961) have been spawned from the fact that check_duplicate_operation will prevent you from writing, appending, or deleting the same file more than once.

### Changes
Removed the offending method and calls. I attempted to pursue a solution where we hashed the content and added it to each line of the file logging command, but then realized there were still cases where this would break (if we appended the same text to the same file twice, which is a perfectly valid operation and common as well). So, just removed the offending code.

### Documentation
Code removed

Ran unittests and prompt asking chatGPT to test the specific scenario

### Summary 💡

As Auto-GPT is a work in progress, it's usual to start over again and again. In this process, the same sites are returned by Google that provide in some cases no real value. I would appreciate it if such URLs could be manually. This would also help to prevent loops in some cases.

In theory, also automatically adding sites to such a list would make sense, but it needs to be used carefully. For automatically adding, a setting could be used e.g. to add sites returning HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx).

### Examples 🌈

In some cases, sites are accessed which return a 404 or contain a totally different topic. It makes no sense to try to access such sites again.

### Motivation 🔦

I love Auto-GPT, but I hate to see it running over the same sites again and again, providing no value and costing tokens. It would increase the efficiency and effectivity of Auto-GPT if the usage of a URL blacklist is possible."

### Summary 💡

We can use auto GPT for free if we could use bing AI instead of openai api key. There are number of projects which are using reverse engineered bing AI so i would suggest to look on that.

The old `devcontainer.json` was not architecture agnostic. It would fail to build on ARM devices. 

Now, with one click, this should automatically start up an Auto-GPT and a Redis container, connect them, and put your VsCode into the development environment of the Auto-GPT container. Regardless of your base operating system or processor architecture. 

### Changes
<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or ""extra"" changes. -->
Modified the `devcontainer.json` to point at the `docker-compose.yml` instead of the `dockerfile`, and modified the `docker-compose.yml` and `dockerfile` from PR #1843 to work while nested inside of the `.devcontainer` folder, as well as other fixes for dev work such as using a default entry-point and keep alive for TTY.

24,"## 🚀 Feature
### Background
Integrating with Aim would be fantastic, as it would provide a convenient method for tracking metadata and storing experiment histories in an intuitive and visually pleasing manner.
To enhance experiment reproducibility and provide a unified, aesthetically pleasing user interface for exploring experiments and their corresponding input/outputs, it is desirable to furnish users with a fast and a solid tool. Aim facilitates gaining deeper insights, thus enhancing the quality of experimentation.

### Changes
The following changes are made in the codebase
- Created `AimCallback` to track input prompts and agent replies, in a separate `aim.py` file.
- Added cli option `--aim-repo` to give a specific Aim repo path if needed.
- Passed an instance of `AimCallback`: `aim_callback` to track the logs in `start_interaction_loop` method 

### Documentation
I've included in-code comments to make it easy for the reviewer to understand.

### Test Plan
I executed Auto-GPT with some tasks and thoroughly explored the Aim UI during the response period of the interaction loop.

26,"Hi, I wonder how to let images as input, it seems that GPT4 not support this now. how to use other llm models or autogpt plugins to support this?"
27,"### Background
Currently the testing steps in github actions do not have any overall timeouts. The total combined time of all the tests can become large. It could also significantly increase our openai cost. The idea of this PR is to try and add a reasonable overall timout to the testing step in our github workflow. Motivation for this PR is the third point in issue #2900 

### Changes
After looking at some f the recent ci.yml jobs in the project, I realised most of the testing jobs take around 1-3 mins of time. So, I've added a overall timeout of 10 minutes in testing job, whihch should be resonable enough for all our tests to finish and yet good enough to interrupt any malformed/misconfigured test runs. Thus making the openai costs somewhat predictable.

### Documentation
The change is self explanatory.

### Test Plan
Tried running an infinite loop in a test and verified that the timeout works as expected.
