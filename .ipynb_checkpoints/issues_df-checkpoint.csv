This change was made to the `ai_config.py` file #185. However, based on a suggestion, the knowledge cutoff was directly added to the `prompt.txt` file. This aims to provide metadata to the AI, enhancing its search coordination and thought processes.

### Changes
A single line was added on top of `prompt.txt` file. The line added is `Knowledge Cutoff Date: Please remember that your knowledge and information are accurate and up-to-date as of September 2021. Please use this information to better coordinate your searches and thoughts.`

### Documentation
Unfortunately, no documentation is made.

### Test Plan
No test was conducted.

### Summary 💡

Add `1/0` as alternative to `y/n`

### Examples 🌈

So in
`Continue (y/n)` and `Enter \'y\' to authorise command, \'y -N\' to run N continuous commands, \'n\' to exit program`
we can use
`Continue (1/0)` and `Enter \'1\' to authorise command, \'1 -N\' to run N continuous commands, \'0\' to exit program`

### Motivation 🔦

A user can communicate with Auto-GPT in a language other than English that does not contain the letters `y`, `n`. In this case, the user have to change the keyboard layout between simple and text response to English and back.

### Summary 💡

Currently Auto-GPT writes the entire python or text file at once. If the file gets beyond a few paragraphs this starts to cause issues often time causing json parsing error. Could we somehow have it insert text into an existing file. Maybe we can have it give vim commands to edit it.

Been running a benchmark of having it write a fluid simulation using the lattice boltzmann method. Been running this everyday for a week or so to see the progress of Auto-GPT developments. I think it is very close to working but need this one last bit of functionality.

### Examples 🌈

Here is an example that I think shows gpt is capable of doing it.

- [X] I have searched the existing issues

### Steps to reproduce 🕹

1. Set API Keys for OpenAI, Pinecone, and Eleven Labs, then set the smart model to gpt-3.5-turbo
2. Start AutoGPT with the --gpt3only option
3. Prompt GPT to be a developer, and give it the goal to load a design document text file into long term memory. and the additional goals to develop the project.

### Current behavior 😯

Currently the AI will read_file the document, and will output a JSON format error as the document is long, hence the need to load it into long term memory, and it just replies with ""sure, I got that""

UNITY-DEV-GPT THOUGHTS: My next step should be to load the design document into long-term memory and review it to understand the current status of the Unity Project. I will use the 'read_file' command to read the file and save the content to long-term memory.
REASONING: I need to get an understanding of the current state of the Unity Project to determine what needs to be implemented next.
PLAN:
-  Read the design document using the 'read_file' command
-  Save the content to long-term memory
-  Review the content to determine the current state of the Unity Project
CRITICISM: The plan is straightforward and efficient, but I should always be careful not to miss or misunderstand any information from the document.

### Expected behavior 🤔

The bot should not read the file but just send it directly to memory as to not overflow the token limit, or if it should be able to do it even with large token files why is it not working?

### Your prompt 📝

```yaml
ai_goals:
- Load the design document file under `./designdocument.txt` into long term memory.
- Find out the currently created files in the unity project under `./UnityProject/Assets`,
  then improve the code according to the design document, solving any issues or bugs
  found.
- Find out what needs to be implemented next, then implement it, then do this step
  again until there is nothing left to implement.
- Double check and make sure everything is implemented in the Unity Project Files
  from your understanding of the project, then refine and criticize the code making
  sure everything is in working order.
- Shut Down.

<!-- Provide a brief overview of why this change is being made. Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->

The aim of this PR is to make the use of Redis Stack beginner friendly and help developers get consistent results.
Developers and curious people can access RedisInsight at  http://localhost:8001/ to see the interaction between Auto-GPT and Redis caching engine.

### Changes

<!-- Describe the changes made in this pull request. Be specific and detailed. -->

Made it easier to use Redis by providing the steps in the updated documentation.
Consistent build, configuration and testing using a docker-compose.yml type of configuration.
Easy start of the Docker container by using a shell script.
Easier debugging and tracing by using Redis Stack with built-in RedisInsight for development cycles.
Better security by enabling an access password for ""Production Ready"".
 
- Updated README.md with a Docker for Linux.
- Added the Docker Compose file as `docker_redis.yml`
- Added a shell script to make it easy to start the container with `start_redis_docker.sh`

### Test Plan

<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->

Configuration validation with `docker-compose -f docker_redis.yml config` on:
- Fedora Linux 37 with Docker version 23.0.3, build 3e7cbfd and Docker Compose version v2.17.2.
- Third party confirmation of correct build on Windows 11 with Docker Desktop 4.18.0 and Docker Compose version v2.17.2.
Multiple build cycles with `docker system prune -a` to eliminate any image conflicts potential

Successful configuration and built of a Docker Stack image and confirmed:
- .env has the correct Redis configuration
- Running Auto-GPT reports “Using memory of type: RedisMemory”
- Checking http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser and confirming the CPU, Total Memory, Total Keys and Connected Clients all report positive non-zero values.

It's possible for your connection being closed causes AutoGPT to crash.

### Changes

Wraps the embeddings call with a try statement and returns an empty list when finding nearest or avoids adding to memory.

Created the scaffolding to get tests setup. Some in the community think for CICD we should use pytest-vcr. I'm passing the work so far on to them to provide recommendations.

This work is branched from https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/pull/142 which needs to be merged first in order for this diff to be small.

Changed from unittest to pytest.
Added a testing.yaml workflow.

### Summary 💡

I have locally installed Auto-GPT 
within the auto_gpt_workspace - I cloned the Auto-GPT repo
I then asked the AI to look up the outstanding issues and begin to repair them
the AI responded that out of at the time 185 outstanding issues it would focus on issue it could solve quickly

this loop continued as it couldn't seem to write files to the local instance

Version 2

I then asked the AI to search the internet on how it could improve itself 
the AI wanted to install machine learning modules - again it was unable to write to the local repo

I am currently consulting ChatGPT-4 directly to assist this upgrade

### Summary 💡

I wrote a python file that i am trying to get auto-gpt to utilize to scrape some data off the internet. To run the file, it requires the use of an argument after the python file. When excecuted, it responds that 'execute_python_file can only execute .py files'. 

### Examples 🌈

NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_python_file ARGUMENTS = {'file': 'name_of_file.py argument'}

expected behavior would be that it runs the python file with the argument and gives the data to auto-gpt

### Motivation 🔦

I noticed auto-gpt struggled with scraping numerical data off the internet so i wrote a python file to find a download button and download the data into .cvs for further data analysis.

### Steps to reproduce 🕹

AI Name: GameDev-GPT

Describe your AI's role:  For example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'
GameDev-GPT is: A game developer able to create browser games with HTML, Javascript and CSS. They use basic graphics and are focused on games played in Firefox on a desktop computer

Enter up to 5 goals for your AI:  For example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'
Enter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.
Goal 1: Create a game design document for a game of Pong
Goal 2: Write the code for the game
Goal 3: Add unit tests to validate that the code is working
Goal 4: Write all the files to disk
Goal 5: Shutdown when complete


### Current behavior 😯

The reason it's failing is because it's trying to set the `fillStyle` of the context to `\'white\'` which has a single backslash to it in the output already but fails to get parsed by standard JSON parsers. It should be `'white'` in this context (the code itself is encapsulated between double quotes and thus unaffected by single quotes, yet GPT-4 still added the back-tick most likely due to it recognizing that strings within strings wouldn't work in most cases).

Current full output that broke the system:

There are 3 instances where `\'white\'` is being used, changing those to `'white'` fixes the JSON issue. 

### Expected behavior 🤔

That GPT-4 doesn't output invalid JSON data when writing code.

There's two ways I see this could be fixed, one would be by adjusting the input prompt to tell it not to add a `\` character to single quotes. The other way would be to add an extra step for when the JSON decoding fails to check and see if there may be instances of `\'` and resolve them (potentially ask the user as well to be sure this could be the fix for the current output)

Big branch build on top of https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/pull/372 (Redis implementation and memory refactor).

We need to improve modularity to scale the project so I created AutoGPT wrapper with the old main.py functionality.

I also added a PydanticParser similar to Langchain with some improvements.

### Changes

- AutoGPT wrapper to instantiate new execution and scale the project (we can add layers on top of single executions).

- PydanticParser to fix the error parsing the JSON and return a notification to the AI pointing the error and asking for a fix with a specific format. (E.g: ```Failed: 
 ERROR = I couldn't parse your format for object: Command, remember you should follow the instructions: The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below. As an example, for the schema {""properties"": {""foo"": {""title"": ""Foo"", ""description"": ""a list of strings"", ""type"": ""array"", ""items"": {""type"": ""string""}}}, ""required"": [""foo""]}} the object {""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {""properties"": {""foo"": [""bar"", ""baz""]}} is not well-formatted. Here is the output schema: {""Command"": {""name"": {""title"": ""Name"", ""description"": ""command name"", ""type"": ""string""}, ""args"": {""title"": ""Args"", ""description"": ""A dictionary where keys and values are both strings, e.g., {'arg1': 'value1', 'arg2': 'value2'}"", ""type"": ""object"", ""additionalProperties"": {""type"": ""string""}}}} ```

- ResponsePrompt a modular prompt for our system which uses default values (and AI specific settings) for now but can be easily reconstructed sending new values (E.g Commands: {new small list of commands for specific task}, Constraints: {the constraints for this agent}.

### Test Plan

Preparing a test for the pydantic parser and the Response prompt formatting.

### Change Safety

I tested my implementation with 20x automatic executions and now we are able to recover from wrong format.

### Summary 💡

Auto-GPT needs an inherent understanding of itself and the ability to connect with other Auto-GPT instances for collaboration. Once we get them talking they can figure out the most efficient way to move forward. 

I was thinking we could have people run instances donating their API key on running an Auto-GPT cluster focused on improving Auto-GPT and implementing the latest technologies and capabilities into itself.

### Summary 💡

Replace Google Search by an agency (coop of agents) to search both Google and pinecone memory from a prompt sent by autogpt to this agency 

Uses multiple instances of a GPT-3.5 model to generate tags for each search engine (e.g., Pinecone and Google) based on the user prompt.

### Background

<!-- Provide a brief overview of why this change is being made. Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->

Discussion created here https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/492
One topic i would like to raise is the use of optional arguments, as Auto seems to ask for it anyway. Maybe we can add a kind of optional flag in the prompt.

### Changes

<!-- Describe the changes made in this pull request. Be specific and detailed. -->
I have added an optional argument and fallback to default if not set.

### Test Plan
Use a prompt that will trigger the ""generate_image"" command and specify in natural language an image size.
<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->

### Change Safety
Only 3 sizes available at the moment, 256, 512, 1024 and with proper format, else fallback to 256x256.

### Background

<!-- Provide a brief overview of why this change is being made. Include any relevant context, prior discussions, or links to relevant issues. -->

One issue I have seen while experimenting with AutoGPT is that it will go deep down irrelevant rabbit holes. In order to address this I am experimenting with having a more structured way of organizing tasks.

### Changes

<!-- Describe the changes made in this pull request. Be specific and detailed. -->
- `TaskManager`: A singleton class responsible for managing tasks, including creating tasks, retrieving tasks by ID, updating task states, and displaying task hierarchy.
- `TaskState`:An enumeration representing the state of a task (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED).
- `Task`: A class representing individual tasks with properties like ID, name, state, parent task, and subtasks.
- New `--taskmanager` command line flag to enable and disable
- New commands for managing tasks: `update_task_state` and `set_current_task`

### Test Plan

<!-- Explain how you tested this functionality. Include the steps to reproduce and any relevant test cases. -->

- Add unit tests for Task Manager, Task, and TaskState

### Outstanding items

- Refine prompt to ensure AutoGPT is always managing tasks
- Allow for programmatically adding task manager portion of prompt based off command line flag

### Change Safety

- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes
- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes

### Summary 💡

Command Generate Image ""generate_image"" is a great addition. However the image size is hardcoded,
I propose the issue to make it controllable with an optional argument image_size.

Pitfalls : 

- Dalle has only 3 sizes ""256x256"", ""512x512"", ""1024x1024"".
- StableDiffusion works with multiple of 8 as valid size, but image may suffer loss of context > 512px.
- image_size argument should be optional and not make it more complicated to generate an image without specifying the size. 

### Examples 🌈

- Stable Diffusion Replica, size can be changed
https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion

- Dall-e API
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/images/create#images/create-size


### Motivation 🔦

This will help the user to generate an image at the needed size.

Felt I need more optionality at start-up: load last settings, load setting file from your history or create new settings. The need came out of running different ""missions"" with changes to the settings and prompts. Wanted an easy way to recall previous settings 

### Changes

See new onboarding flow here: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1012888/230700981-90509b51-c38a-47d6-96bf-47519c91c6d3.mov

- Created new structure in scripts/data:
```bash
scripts/data/ai_settings
scripts/data/ai_settings/last_settings.yaml
scripts/data/ai_settings/history
scripts/data/ai_settings/history/settings_20230407-195943.yaml [every setting that is run is saved in the history dir]
```
- Refactored `main.py/construct_prompt` to support 3 onboarding options:
```bash
Welcome! Please select one of the following options:
a - Load last used settings
b - Load another settings file
c - Create new settings
```
- Refactored ai_config to support new i/o stuff


### Test Plan

- Manual testing throw each onboarding flow and i/o operation

### Change Safety

- [ ] I have added tests to cover my changes
- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes

### Summary 💡

Looking at Microsoft’s Jarvis and the improvement seen with refinement (where GPT is prompted after it’s response “did you do the last task correctly?”). Perhaps we could implement a refinement check before proceeding on a task, and use some sort of sentiment analysis from hugging face to then turn that into a Boolean of continue or refine. Then if it still fails after 3 or so retries it could ask a question back to the user for help where it got stuck.

### Summary 💡

My current challenge is it's hard to know how much it's costing me to run autoGPT for each session (for OPEN_AI in particular)

If I knew how much it was costing me and the current cost per session I could make informed decisions about running in continuous mode or authorizing discrete tasks.

First it would be great just to see estimated costs per session.

Second, I would like to be able to set budget for each session with a soft/hard cap.

For example a soft cap of $2 would mean it leaves continuous mode when it nears $2 estimated cost and you see a warning.
A hard cap would end the session for me, but is optional.
If neither are provided it runs as expected.

Thanks,
Tim

I am using Auto-GPT search, browse and summarize code in another project and using this parallelization of single url summarization and summarizing multiple urls. 
As most of the processing is IO bound I find this approach to be useful.


### Changes

* Added ChatRequest class which encapsulates openai.ChatCompletion parameters and adds an optional key to requests.
* Added ChatResponse class which encapsulates a ChatRequest and its reply (or Exception)
* Added async_chat_completion to llm_utils with ChatRequest input ChatResponse output
* Changed summarize_text to be async, parallelizing chunks summarizations.
* Created a search file and moved relevant functions into it from commands
* Made get_text_summary async. Can be used to summarize multiple urls in parallel depending on num_sources requested (default is 1)
* Moved main loop into an async function to be asyncio.run from  main.
* Had an issue with Pinecone memory clear() so put it in try/except

### Test Plan

test_search - test_search_and_summarize_multiple_sources get 5 links from google_official_search and creates summaries from 3. It fails on the NYT and generates the third summary from the 4th url. (can't really build on this flow)

Devs and aspiring contributors frequently have dependency conflicts when trying to clone the repo and build dependencies for the first time. 

Adding an alternate requirements file:
- Removes package versions, allowing pip to resolve dependency conflicts with less strict versioning
- Explicitly adds packages to be installed, that was being missed by pip and resulting in 'module not found' errors


### Changes

Add a new requirements-alternate.txt

### Test Plan

Other contributors and myself have found success with this requirements file, as opposed to the main one.

### Steps to reproduce 🕹

N/A

### Current behavior 😯

Auto-GPT has limited test coverage, which makes it difficult to ensure that changes to the codebase do not introduce new bugs or regressions. 

Given the [latest commit](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/commit/c6d90227fecec8acc1481c486a91337b07e8a820), testing is now part of all new pull requests.

### Expected behavior 🤔

By improving test coverage, we can ensure that the codebase is more robust and that future changes can be made with confidence.

Hey everyone, I saw some Twitter posts about people being able to install react apps and what not but didn't seem to be able to get it to work on my end. So, I took a stab at creating a module for working with react apps and adding github versioning functions. If anyone has any input or is willing to help me test this please ping me! 

Don't know how safe it is to update the prompt either, seems to ""on the nose""

### Changes
This pull request adds the following changes:

- Added react_operations.py module for React app management
- Added git_operations.py module for GitHub repository management
- Added environment variables for GitHub username and PAT in the .env file
- Updated the execute_command() function to include new React and GitHub commands in the AI agent prompt

### Summary 💡

I'm wondering whether Auto-GPT, even if it's written in Python, could support other programming languages as well, since GPT is able to program in multiple ones.

I'm also thinking that Auto-GPT could be more effective in languages with a good type system, like Rust or Haskell. That's because function signatures give a lot of information to understand what a function does: we could be very efficient in token usage, if we transmitted function signatures without a function body.

### Summary 💡

Implement ""Fully Air-Gapped Offline Auto-GPT"" functionality that allows users to run Auto-GPT without any internet connection, relying on local models and embeddings.

This feature depends on the completion of the feature requests [#347 Support Local Embeddings](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/347) and [#25 Suggestion: Add ability to choose LLM endpoint](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/25).

### Examples 🌈

1. Secure facilities with strict data access controls can utilize Auto-GPT without risking sensitive information leaks.
2. Researchers working in remote locations without internet access can continue to experiment with and use Auto-GPT.
3. Users who prefer not to rely on cloud services can run Auto-GPT entirely within their local environment.
4. Robots can make decisions and communicate using LLMs even when they can't connect to the internet.

### Motivation 🔦

1. Enhanced Security: Fully air-gapped Auto-GPT ensures that no sensitive data is transmitted over the internet, protecting it from potential leaks or unauthorized access.
2. Offline Capabilities: This feature allows users to leverage Auto-GPT's power in environments with limited or no internet access, expanding its potential use cases.
3. Reduced Dependency: By removing reliance on external servers, users gain greater control over their data and can manage resources more efficiently.
4. Cost Savings: By not requiring cloud-based services, users can save on costs related to storage, data transfer, and processing.
5. Customization and Control: Users can manage their own models and embeddings, tailoring the system to their specific needs and preferences.

### Summary 💡

Local Models (LLaMA & its finetunes) now work in a fork of Auto-GPT, including with Pinecone Embeddings. See https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/25#issuecomment-1499531177

Local models and embeddings offer better privacy, lower costs, and enable new uses, like Auto-GPT experiments in private/air-gapped networks. To get these benefits, we should add local (offline) embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT.

### Examples 🌈

A version of ooba's text-generation-webui, called [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory), has done this using zarr and Numpy. Check [wawawario2/long_term_memory#how-it-works-behind-the-scenes](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory#how-it-works-behind-the-scenes)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5949853/230487779-d6748718-8ee0-49b6-9026-6758b48deaae.png)

Though the Auto-GPT fork uses ooba's webui API for local models, the long_term_memory project is closely tied to ooba's UI. We mention it only as a reference. We need to create a similar setup in Auto-GPT.

### Motivation 🔦

1. Better Privacy: Local embeddings keep user data on their devices or networks, avoiding the risk of online data breaches.
2. Lower Costs: Users save money on cloud storage, bandwidth, and processing power when they use local embeddings.
3. Offline Use: Auto-GPT can work in offline environments or areas with limited internet, like secure facilities or remote research stations.
4. Customization: Users can create and manage their own embeddings for better model performance and results.
5. Faster Response: Local embeddings can speed up response times since data doesn't need to travel to remote servers.

By adding local embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT, users get more control, flexibility, and benefits like privacy, cost savings, and accessibility.",https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/347/timeline,,,MarkSchmidty,5949853,MDQ6VXNlcjU5NDk4NTM=,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5949853?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty,https://github.com/MarkSchmidty,https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/followers,https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/repos,https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/MarkSchmidty/received_events,User,False,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/347/reactions,7,7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.
 If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI. Try changing it up slightly.
 
 I'm using GPT3.5.

### Summary 💡

Idea:

- Add a `ai_settings` directory to contain yaml files in the form of `last_run_ai_settings.yaml`. This way we could create and share interesting or successful ""missions."" 
- Update `scripts/main/parse_arguments` so you can easily load any of the `...ai_settings.yaml` files in the `ai_settings` directory.

Planning to add this to my local fork. Happy to do a PR if others like the idea :)

ps - awesome tool! thanks for sharing with the community!

### Summary 💡

Right now I am experimenting with a Wikidata Query command in auto-gpt on my repo: https://github.com/stefangrotz/Auto-GPT-Wikidata

Feel free to join!

Once this works well I can create a pull request and add this functionality to this repo. Would this make sense to you? 

At one point some sort of plugin system will be inevitable, but Wikidata could be usefull enought to become part of the main system since it gives you acces to all kind of data in a structured way. This includes lists of API endpoints of Open Data CKAN Portals and many other useful data that is hard to find just using google.

### Examples 🌈

Here is an example how this can look:

```
CODEREVIEW-GPT THOUGHTS: Let's find some code to review and suggest improvements.
REASONING: We need to search for files with common code extensions that are not too large and more recent than a certain date.
PLAN:
-  Use the 'evaluate_code' command to run a Python script that searches for files with common code extensions in the current folder and subfolders.
-  Use the 'memory_add' command to save the file paths for later reference and reuse.
-  Review the saved files using 'read_file' command to ensure they are indeed code files.
-  Choose a file to review and suggest improvements.
CRITICISM: We may need to adjust the search criteria if we don't find relevant code or if too many files match the criteria.
NEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = evaluate_code ARGUMENTS = {'code': 'import pathlib\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef find_code_files(root: str, extensions: List[str], max_size: int, min_date_modified: float) -> List[str]:\n """"""\n Returns a list of file paths for code files with the specified extensions, maximum size, and minimum date modified\n rooted in the given directory and its subdirectories.\n """"""\n files = [str(path) for path in pathlib.Path(root).rglob(""*"") if path.suffix in extensions\n and path.stat().st_size <= max_size\n and path.stat().st_mtime >= min_date_modified]\n return files\n\ndef print_files(files: List[str])

On one hand, that's a bug, which is addressed on #101.

On the other hand... that's a very interesting idea from GPT.

Modularize the code: Separate the functions in commands.py into different modules based on their functionality. For example, you can create a module for file operations, another for memory management, and so on.

Error handling: Improve error handling by providing more informative error messages and handling edge cases that might cause the program to crash.

Code readability: Add more comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each function and its expected inputs and outputs.

Testing: Write unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected and to catch any potential issues during development.

Security: Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as code injection.

Configuration: Use a configuration file or environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys, rather than hardcoding them in the script.

Logging: Implement a proper logging system to track the application's activities and make debugging easier.

feel free to close this again rightaway since I dont know if the is an issue at all.

In some demos when the AI creates a new instance, the new instance speaks with a female voice, an the conversation between the AI is easy to follow.
When I try it, all GPS's speak in the same male voice, so the conversation is a bit consusing.

Is this expected or an error.
If its expected, I would like to recommend to add a option for changing the voices :-) . Thanks.

since this is an evolving system, i think we should use collective experience, and like a tesla fleet, get better collectively
### Proposal: Record Insights, Submit for review, Use Pinecone Embeddings
if a task is requested and it takes it X iterations to solve it, what if we can make a report of insights might save us steps in the future, should we try again, or advise others to replicate. 
There are 7k+ people who started and might be using Auto-GPT, together, the learning curve can be increadible
One important thing to remember, is to check each submit and flag potentially harmful insite reports
Then we need to come up with a rating mechanism, like stars, flags, something like stackoverflow, that agents can mark if some insight was helpful, or not helpful, etc, and this database of solutions/insights will be a fluid and evolving knowledge base
might even be wise to allocate ""repositories"" or ""namespaces"" that can be verified by the comunity, the repo can be a client to a public pinecone server, that is managed and verified by the comunity and only accepts verified insight submissions

Like a good fleet, we need to share with eachother all the safe and useful progress, and flag bad practices

If you get my drift, please tag relevant people you think are up for it
If you're worried about token costs, remember this might save multi steps, and also we should have gpt4all soon, and it can also just be a powerful opt-in

Would love to know your thoughts on this feature
Thanks and have a good one!

I propose a new feature called ""Semi-Active Mode,"" which enables the AI to run in a semi-automated manner, seeking user assistance when it encounters uncertainty, confusion, or ambiguity. This feature combines the benefits of Continuous Mode with the human-in-the-loop experience of Active Mode.

## Background

Currently, there are two modes available:

1. ""[Continuous Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/#-continuous-mode-%EF%B8%8F),"" which allows the AI to run without user authorization and is 100% automated. However, this mode is not recommended due to its potential dangers, such as running indefinitely or performing actions that users might not approve.
2. ""[Active Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/13),"" which enables the AI to run while actively prompting the user with chain-of-thought questions when executing each subsequent action. This allows users to actively participate while the AI agent runs, ensuring a human-in-the-loop experience.

To further enhance user engagement and provide a more flexible experience, I propose a new feature called ""Semi-Active Mode.""

## Feature Description

In ""Semi-Active Mode,"" the AI will:

1. Execute an action.
2. Evaluate its confidence in the action or result.
3. If the confidence is below a certain threshold, prompt the user for assistance or clarification.
4. Incorporate the user's input and continue to the next action.

This interaction pattern allows users to assist when needed while still benefiting from the AI's capabilities. It strikes a balance between full automation and active participation, fostering a collaborative environment between the user and the AI system.

## Example Implementation

Here's an example implementation using LangChain's [Human-As-A-Tool](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/human_tools.html) feature:

```python
import sys
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
math_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    [""human"", ""llm-math""], 
    llm=math_llm,
)

agent_chain = initialize_agent(
    tools,
    llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)

agent_chain.run(""What is Eric Zhu's birthday?"")
```

In this code, the AI agent seeks human assistance when it encounters uncertainty, allowing the user to guide as needed.

## Benefits

-  Enhanced user engagement
-  Reduced risk of AI performing unwanted actions
-  Increased collaboration between the user and the AI
-  Balances automation and user control

## Risks and Mitigations

This feature may slow down the overall AI operation due to the need for user input in certain situations. However, this trade-off is acceptable, considering the increased control and collaboration it provides.

* Replacing the `os` and `os.path` modules with the `pathlib module`, which simplifies file and directory operations while providing better readability.
* Improving exception handling by using specific exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError) instead of generic exceptions where appropriate. This change enables more informative error messages to be returned to the user.
* Updating error message formatting by using f-strings, which enhances readability and consistency.


These updates contribute to a more robust and maintainable file operations module, making it easier to understand and modify in the future.

```
In this modified version, the call_ai_function takes an additional parameter config_path which defaults to ""config.ini"". The function reads the config file, retrieves the Chosen_Model value, and uses it as the model for the OpenAI API call. If the Chosen_Model flag is not found in the config file, it defaults to ""gpt-4"".

 the if/elif structure is used to call different AI APIs based on the chosen model from the configuration file. Replace some_other_api with the name of the API you'd like to use, and replace parameters with the appropriate parameters required by that API. You can extend the if/elif structure to include more AI APIs as needed.",https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/25/timeline,,,DataBassGit,126125195,U_kgDOB4SEiw,https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/126125195?v=4,,https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit,https://github.com/DataBassGit,https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/followers,https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/following{/other_user},https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/gists{/gist_id},https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/starred{/owner}{/repo},https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/subscriptions,https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/orgs,https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/repos,https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/events{/privacy},https://api.github.com/users/DataBassGit/received_events,User,False,,,,,,https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/25/reactions,11,0,0,0,0,0,9,2,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The **ULTIMATE** achievement for this project would be if Auto-GPT was able to recursively improve itself. That, after-all, is how AGI is predicted by many to come about. 

## Suggestion 👩‍💻
Auto-GPT should be able to:

- [ ] Read it's own code
- [ ] Evaluate it's limitations and areas for improvement
- [ ] Write code to increase it's abilities
- [ ] Write tests for it's code and carry out those tests

## Further down the line: 📃

- [ ] Browse it's own code on GitHub
- [ ] Evaluate, find bugs, etc
- [ ] Submit pull requests

2.  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/GammaTauAI/reflexion-human-eval)
