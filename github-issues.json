Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nI wanted to test the functionality of autoGPT without having to pay for each request. I already had a local model of vicuna 13b, running in [oobabooga's webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), which has an API extension. I wanted to extend autoGPT's functionality to support the use of this API. I think this could be useful to lower the cost of using the project, which could make it more accessible to contribute and test.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAdd support for oobabooga webui API, as an alternative to openai APIs\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI've added the config option \"use_webui\". When this option is set to true, autoGPT will redirect requests to the webui API running on port 5005.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI ran the model and it seemed to work, although it appeared that either vicuna is not powerful enough to understand the prompts, or the prompts are specifically targetted towards GPT. Either way I figure the code is better shared than kept to myself.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [*] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [*] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [*] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [*] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [*] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nOptimize the text processing code by loading the spaCy model and adding the sentencizer only once, outside of the split_text function. This change avoids the overhead of loading the model and adding the pipeline component each time the split_text function is called, which improves the efficiency of the code.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nMoved the loading of the spaCy model and adding the \"sentencizer\" outside of the split_text function.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe code changes are self-explanatory and do not require additional in-code comments or external documentation.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nUsed and time to run was slightly less.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or

Ideally, this would be explicit.\r\n\r\nSo given a task from the user (or a list of goals) The task planner agent will make a list of next tasks to do with their completion status.\r\n\r\nThen we will store these tasks in a queue and pop off the first one with all dependencies done and give it to an execution agent.\r\nThe execution agent eventually should have a minified task command set for the problem to reduce unnecessary and incorrect commands, but for now, it will just execute with the agent it currently uses in the main execution loop.\r\n\r\nConcretely here this is from an architecture perspective. \r\n\r\nThe user enters a task they wish the agent to do.\r\n\r\nWe add a new class called TaskManagerLLM.\r\nAs we enter chat.py the objective and current task list if there is one is fed into taskManagerLLM and an empty initial result is fed into it.\r\nTask manager LLM creates up to 7 tasks it should do to accomplish this task. It numbers them with priority and marks dependencies where dependencies are based off of a linked list pointer structure. It also will have the specific command that should be used for each of them. It will not have in it what parameters are to that command though.\r\n\r\nIt's prompt should be very similar to the existing execution agent with the following components:\r\nThoughts:\r\nReasoning:\r\nTask List in JSON\r\nCriticism:\r\nSpeak:\r\nTask List JSON.\r\n\r\nWe then extract that JSON using our existing JSON parsing toolset.\r\nSort the created tasks without dependencies and then pick the top one. \r\nGive that task to an execution agent.\r\n\r\nAn execution agent will function the same way that an existing agent does. It will make a plan for it's very simple  (by comparison task.)\r\nThe execution agent will do a one shot evaluation with the \"smart\" model to generate the given command with the correct params.\r\nTo support this, we will first generate relevant context for it by having one more previous command to an LLM that takes in the output from the planning agent, and the goal, and the given task that has been selected and the results from previously completed tasks and have it output a prompt for the agent that succinctly describes the problem the agent is solving by executing that command.\r\n\r\nThe biggest potential problem with this is having this function with summation based or vectorized based memory.\r\n\r\nFor now, each completed task would get added to memory with the reasoning associated with it.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the above is overly complex, and we just need an ordered task list based on commands in the planning step and its summarization memory. I might implement that first and see how it does.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nOne example of a specific implementation can be found here: https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi/blob/main/classic/BabyBeeAGI\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nWe have a lot of performance degradation for a few reasons. Myself, and a few of the other people doing benchmarks have kind of realized that it isn't useful to do benchmarks at this point because they mostly just show how unreliable the agent is. No point in doing token counting for instance if the agent only finishes the simplist tasks 50% of the time.\r\n\r\nA lot of the problems with memory and elsewhere is the fact that we have all of this random crap that isn't relevant to the current task and we don't really process well with respect to planning what our next task is, or plan well for next task should be, or really process what our previous tasks accomplished were. And we spend a lot of precious token real estate on stuff that is mostly just confusing to the agent.\r\n\r\nThe basic thought is, if you have a call to an agent that maintains a list of tasks done, their results and what tasks should be accomplished next, and another separate execution agent, that takes that output and then executes on it for a simple task you should get far better performance. \r\n\r\nEventually, I would want to make all of the details for each task queryable so that if previous similar tasks have been executed before, we could feed that into the execution agent, but currently I think I want to keep an initial PR simple. \r\nSo my hope is to work on this, and then circle back around and show we can actually finish some benchmarks reliably", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3593/reactions", "total_count": 3, "+1": 3, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3593/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3589", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3589/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3589/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3589/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3589", "id": 1690010152, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5PdbVD", "number": 3589, "title": "Refactor milvus tests to conform with pytest", "user": {"login": "rihp", "id": 12145726, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTQ1NzI2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12145726?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp", "html_url": "https://github.com/rihp", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/rihp/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5410633608, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQn-3iA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/size/l", "name": "size/l", "color": "709B6D", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-04-30T17:38:49Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-30T18:07:07Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/3589", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3589", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3589.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3589.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!-- \u26a0\ufe0f At the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, instead of defining the desired Python interpreter version in multiple places, it's possible to make use of the `.python-version` file which can be read by [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nWhen detected, the desired interpreter version is set.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\n- Add the `.python-version` file, set the value to correspond to the one used in the `Dockerfile`.\r\n- Consume the `.python-version` file in the relevant GitHub Actions workflows.\r\n- Remove the `.python-version` from `.gitignore`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nI added an explanation in the commit message.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nCI will fail if this change doesn't work.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n\r\nThese are likely not applicable.\r\n\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3576/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3576/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3575", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3575/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3575/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3575/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3575", "id": 1689905624, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5kuenY", "number": 3575, "title": "http.client.RemoteDisconnected: Remote end closed connection without response", "user": {"login": "elake2018", "id": 40440947, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQwNDQwOTQ3", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40440947?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018", "html_url": "https://github.com/elake2018", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/elake2018/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5419219150, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQwK4zg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/stability", "name": "stability", "color": "6CAF43", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 2, "created_at": "2023-04-30T12:47:53Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T01:27:27Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### \u26a0\ufe0f Search for existing issues first \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues, and there is no existing issue for my problem\n\n### Which Operating System are you using?\n\nWindows\n\n### Which version of Auto-GPT are you using?\n\nStable (branch)\n\n### GPT-3 or GPT-4?\n\nGPT-3.5\n\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\n\nI really don't know how to tell you how to reproduce the issue but I was trying to build a website using an image I have locally.

something that already covers this, \r\nI did try look through other posts, but i didnt see anything that quite obviously covered this.\r\n\r\nAt present, it seems the only way to use Auto-GPT at present is GPT4 API Keys with OpenAI.\r\nWhich is valid considering its early stages, but it shouldn't take much new code to add this functionality, \r\n\r\nRequired functionality can be summarized as:\r\n1: Allowing users to choose another \"Host/IP\" other than OpenAI, TCP/IP Ports if required\r\n2: The \"Category\" of the linked model (Language Model, Diffusion, TTS, Image to Text, STT, etc)\r\n3: And specifying relevant API Key\r\nThe first two being the only new features on this end.\r\n\r\nResults would obviously vary, but the additional options would be good for the community.\r\n\r\nA gentle colab with the folks working on Serge could go a long way for the self-hosting folks, \r\nWhere as other parties might take a bit longer.\r\n\r\nThe Serge end of the problem requires them to solve their User profiles & authentication roadmap item, assuming that API integration would be part of the Authentication category.\r\n\r\nThe ideal end-state for such a feature would be, allowing auto-gpt to call multple models as part of a chain, depending on what is required. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nConsider the prompt: \r\n\"Write a short book of poems about AI, each poem should have a simple related graphic\"\r\n\r\nAction chain would resemble: \r\nPrompt -> GPT -> outline for book ->  \r\nGPT -> response -> Elaborate on each item of outline -> \r\nGPT -> firstItemResponse -> Stable Diffusion -> AssociatedGraphic Response -> \r\nCombinedResponse -> next item until complete -> book image -> \r\nproject folder -> announce complete.\r\n\r\nCreating a soundbite based on a prompt would have a similar flow, except instead of generating images, the Auto-GPT would feed the text prompt into a TTS ML via a similar chain of Hosts/API settings.\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nThis would enable those that are either Self Hosting GPT//LLaMAs, \r\nor leveraging other models through huggingface/similar parties,\r\nto make use of Auto-GPT, and empower their projects.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3553/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0,

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nI feel that \"question\" and \"summary\" are bad words to use when prompting an AI to extract data from a webpage. They're too general. Thus, I fixed the browse prompt to reflect my opinion. This ended up significantly improving GPT-3's performance in summarizing website content. By telling it to use maximum detail, the browse outputs won't get (as) decreasingly verbose and simple, which would lead to a bad final summary. The caveat of this is potentially using more tokens because the summaries will be longer, but at least the AI won't be neutered by bad browsing functionality.\r\n\r\nThis also makes it so you won't go homeless from needing to use GPT-4 to get decent website summaries.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nChanged the browse prompt to be more effective.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nNothing is added, only changed. No documentation necessary (I don't think).\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI've tested this over the course of many different prompts on my own repo and I can say confidently that this alternate browse prompt significantly increases the quality of the summary returned. You'll see that the summaries are much, much more information dense and character-efficient.

The fact that I can't find where the initial prompt is anymore prevents me from making this change myself. If anyone wants to make this change or inform me how to do so, it'll happen, but I think this would be a fine PR merge even without that.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

On first iteration this function always sends a prompt to GPT. But what if we had auto-gpt running and then stopped it manually before running a command (or had a power outage)? And then we want it continue running from this command? What was the reasoning behind making auto-gpt always run from ground up, even if there is available `ai_settings.yaml` and we want to continue running with it?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't seem that hard to support it, we will just need to preserve `full_message_history` and not clear `memory` on each run (and also do the same for every agent in agent_manager I guess). So I'd just like to know why this feature hasn't been considered initially? I can think and try to implement it, but first I need to understand if it doesn't go against the design of the project.\r\n\r\nThere are some active issues addressing it like https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1176 or https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/822, but it doesn't seem that they also address the core issue that `start_interaction_loop` always run initial prompt for some reason, what was the reasoning behind that (and why don't we allow to persist message history between `auto-gpt` launches)?\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nIt will be pretty convenient for cases when for example user shutdowns their pc or electricity crashes and their auto-gpt stops running,

When using latest release I got errors when loading URLs all the time, even wrong URLs were loaded when using Chrome as selenium browser. Also there were problems with lots of pages having cookie concent popping over the page, making the logic collapse as the cookie concent page were scraped by AutoGPT instead of the real page (after the concent which wasnt done).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis change adds 2 configurable settings for the .env file, you can add a Chrome user-data-dir which is already logged in to all pages needed avoiding the Cookie concent problem. Also you can enable fixing the errors so many people are reporting on windows, and now it all works great.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI belive the changes should be selv explanatory, I did add some comments describing aswell.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nShould be tested on windows where you have problems with loading URL, there are loads of people reporting this.\r\nQuick google search for the

https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\n-->\n\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\n\nFocus on a single, specific change.\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\n\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\n\n### Background\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\n\nWhen trying to get Auto-GPT to write and improve on a script, the existing behavior which prevents writing to the same file more than once got in the way.\n\n### Changes\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\n\n* Duplication checks now constructs a file store state using a checksum for matching.\n* Writes with different checksums will succeed, but will fail with the same checksum.\n* Added tests, minor refactoring.\n\n### Documentation\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\n\nDocstrings, tests, concise code.\n\n### Test Plan\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nSince some days back in master, when started in Docker files have always tried to be written to /app/autogpt/auto_got_workspace which is unfortunate, since the workspace is mounted under /app/auto_gpt_workspace\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nThis has been manually tested in Docker and the file path when writing files is now again correct.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\nI do not know enough Python to do this. I would rather than someone with more python experience had done this and will yeild happily. It's just that this is such a low-hanging fruit that seems to bother quite a lot of people so I thought I would have a stab at it. \r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should

using the terms \"maximum FOO\" (context, tokens, time, memory, space etc).\r\n\r\nThus, more broadly, it might make sense to encode support for actual constraints as a first class concept into the design, so that under the hood, the system is aware of its own resource utilization (execution time, space, traffic, tokens, context, API usage and so on).\r\n\r\nAs to API usage/billing, it would currently have to scrape some of the openai pages apparently.\r\n\r\nThat way, planning would also be better informed/simplified, because the system could take into account the \"costs\" of its operations.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing would also make it possible to constrain the system when it is behind a low-bandwidth connection, and e.g. prioritize other work, to reduce bandwidth utilization \r\n\r\nCould be thought of as the equivalent of Unix/Linux \"quotas\" - i.e. a way to monitor resource utilization for different types of resources - which also be a great thing for benchmarking purposes\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\n_No response_", "reactions": {"url":

(it can even used for a sub part \"the older memories\" only rather then the whole memory)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-28 030144](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74210873/235036626-d0341bdc-9514-4594-abed-38c5f96f958b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nI have multiple ideas and architectures to use for this specific feature and I would really love to contact anyone to further discuss this feature and I would do my best to work on it. \r\n\r\nI also have multiple other ideas but much more complex (such as creating an super agent who creates multiple agents) but that is for the future. \r\n\r\nIf something would change the world in future, it is autonomous artificial general intelligence that exponentially scales.

prompt_settings.yaml) \r\nCan be set from .env (PROMPT_SETTINGS_FILE) or by commandline (--prompt-settings or -P)\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nThe main reason for proposed this changes is because they can help with with different LLM models, we talked about that in #25 #567 #2158.\r\nThey don't handle the prompts in the same way as GPT3.5/GPT4, and they often get confused. this way can be easy to create and share prompts made specifically for them.\r\n\r\nAlso, it can be useful for models made for different languages, like for example https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/LLMZoo\r\n\r\n....Or just for people who want to have more control on what AutoGPT can do without having to modify the code\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nMoved the hardcoded default prompt constraints, resources and performance evaluation form prompt.py to the new file prompt_settings.yaml, wich will be used as default file.\r\n\r\nAdded the new configuration variable PROMPT_SETTINGS_FILE in .env.template and modified config.py to handle it\r\n\r\nAdded the new file autogpt/config/prompt_config.py, wich contain the PromptConfig class, wich is initialized passing the file path and contains the datas from the configuration file\r\n\r\nMoved the hardcoded default prompt constraints, resources and performance evaluation form prompt.py to the new file prompt_settings.yaml, wich will be used as default file.\r\n\r\nModified prompt.py to use the values from the PromptConfig instead of hardcoded datas\r\n\r\nModified cli.py, main.py and configurator.py to handle the new --prompt-settings / -P commandline args\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe new .env variable PROMPT_SETTINGS_FILE is described there, while the new --prompt-settings/-P comd line args are described both in cli.py and in usage.md.\r\nI followed the same policy used for the ai.settings.yaml file\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n- Start AutoGPT without modifying any configurations, should work just as before\r\n- Start AutoGPT using --prompt-settings (file) (ex. python -m autogpt -P prompt_settings_ex.yaml), where file doesn't exists or isn't valid. AutoGPT should give a validation error and stop\r\n- Start AutoGPT using after setting PROMPT_SETTINGS_FILE=(file), where file doesn't exists or isn't valid. AutoGPT should give a validation error and stop\r\n- Copy the prompt_settings.yaml file and change it a bit, while keeping it still valid.

The rationale is to improve the user experience when listening to the TTS output.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nThe following changes were made:\r\n\r\n1. Update the `_speech` function with an additional line of code to remove URLs from the input text using a regular expression.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\n#... macOS TTS code ...\r\n\r\ndef _speech(self, text: str, voice_index: int = 0) -> bool:\r\n    text = re.sub(r'\\b(?:https?://[-\\w_.]+/?\\w[-\\w_.]*\\.(?:[-\\w_.]+/?\\w[-\\w_.]*\\.)?[a-z]+(?:/[-\\w_.%]+)*\\b(?!\\.))', '', text)\r\n    #... remaining macOS TTS code ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Imported the `re` library to handle regular expressions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe new code removes URLs from the input text using a regular expression. The `re` library was imported to handle regex patterns, and the URLs are removed from the text using the `re.sub` function. The code has an appropriate in-line comment explaining the purpose of the change.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n\r\n1. Test various input text strings containing URLs and verify that the URLs are removed from the TTS output.\r\n2. Test the functionality with multiple different voices to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This enhancement is particularly useful for users who pre-authorize commands and want to track their progress.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn this pull request, the following modifications were made to the `agent.py` file:\r\n\r\n1. Added a conditional statement `elif` under the main control flow to handle cases where `self.next_action_count > 0` and `cfg.continuous_mode` is `False`.\r\n2. Used the `logger.typewriter_log()` function to display the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action, including the command name and its arguments.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are documented through in-code comments and this external documentation, which clearly explain the new behavior added to Auto-GPT after merging this pull request. The number of authorized commands left will be displayed in cyan color when the user is not in continuous mode, and the details of the next action, including the command name and its arguments, will be displayed in both continuous and non-continuous modes.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTo test this functionality:\r\n\r\n1. Ran Auto-GPT with the updated `autogpt/agent/agent.py` file .\r\n2. Pre-authorized commands using `y -n`, where `n` is the numerical value of commands you want to authorize.\r\n3. Observed the number of authorized commands left and the details of the next action being displayed after every message in the specified color when not in continuous mode.\r\n4. Verified that the output aligns with the expected behavior as described.\r\n\r\nFlake8 and PyTest run without any issues.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

I will add it to the list of missing packages and skip any commands that require Git.\\n- If Git is installed, I will try to clone the repository again.\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to make sure that I am checking for the correct error and that I am able to clone the repository correctly.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_shell ARGUMENTS = {'command_line': 'git --version'}\r\n```\r\n", "reactions":

\r\nPrevious PR closed to rename the branch & feature. \r\n\r\n# DO NOT ACCEPT \r\nThis are core changes introduced in issue #3039  \r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a 3 layers architecture where you have : \r\n* **Management of project / instances**\r\nThe capacity to create different project with different targets (example build a website, plan a travel, plan a wedding & do my shopping)\r\n* **Management of team of agents**\r\nThe capacity to operate different agent willing to work on the same project(example build a website)\r\n* **Agents**\r\nThe capacity to operate with a AI Model to perform a certain set of task/logical operations.\r\n\r\nThis PR cover the first level & would be compatible with plugins such as Dolly that manage the second level in a modular set-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis are core changes introduced in issue #3039  , PR conflicting with #1937 (who cover the 2 first level)  but can complement with doll GPT who covers only the second level\r\n> > > * **Core model :** Should we keep both model ? Should we push one one forward ? I think your Core Model may pose problem when the Agent is not interacting with a LLM. So I will definitively push my idea until proven otherwise.\r\n> > \r\n> > The separation of projects and agents in my approach was decided to simplify the configs so that they could be transferred to other projects more easily, and to allow for the growth of the agent models.\r\n> > \r\n> > It could be possible to combine the different models, i.e. have a project folder structure, then a single yaml to handle the projects and agents.\r\n> \r\n> Hey , There is a bit more to that the difference is that : \r\n> * Via #1937 you can build interaction with each agent of the Project , also agent must be LLM but it is scalable \r\n> * Via #3039 you interact with a leader that does all the job of managing the other agents\r\n> \r\n> It is why we provide response to similar needs but with two very different solution which are not mergeable, it can be two modes offered but it is definitively two very different way of seeing the product\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n### Done : \r\n* Refactorisation of the core to allow to create multiple instance (project)\r\n* Each project has one AI (a lead)\r\n* Designed to get each AI able to manage 1 team of Agent (not necessarily LLM)\r\n* Renaming AI in Agent\r\n\r\n### Need : \r\n* Split ai_config.py in 3 files\r\n* Remove commented code\r\n* Create unit test\r\n* Put more comment on the code\r\n* Manage memory back-ends\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nIn code for the moment\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nPlan to generate Unit Test & Perform End to End test tuning scenarii\r\n\r\n## PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ ] My pull request is atomic

PostgresML is an open-source machine learning extension to PostgreSQL that enables training and inference on text and tabular data. With PostgresML, you can integrate machine learning models into your PostgreSQL database. In addition, you can use your existing PostgreSQL database as a vector database by generating embeddings from text stored in the database.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n- [Generating LLM embeddings with open source models in PostgresML](https://postgresml.org/blog/generating-llm-embeddings-with-open-source-models-in-postgresml)\r\n- [PostgresML as a Vector Database](https://github.com/postgresml/postgresml#vector-database)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- Each file that has been edited/added has respective inline comments\r\n- Updated `docs/configuration/memory.md` with an additional section on PostgresML installation instructions and `pip` dependencies\r\n- `pip` dependencies for PostgresML are not included in the requirements.txt\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nThese steps are included [in documentation](https://github.com/santiatpml/Auto-GPT/blob/memory-postgresml/docs/configuration/memory.md#postgresml-setup). Rewriting summary here:\r\n\r\n1. Install PostgresML using Docker or spin up a PostgresML cloud database\r\n2. Clone Auto-GPT and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`\r\n3. To use PostgresML memory backend: \r\n    - Install libpq-dev : `sudo apt install libpq-dev`\r\n    - `pip install psycopg2` \r\n4. `python -m autogpt -m postgresml` will use PostgresML as memory backend\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n<!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nThe community added smaller unit tests created recently, however we need more integration tests to make sure AutoGPT is not regressing with updates and acting the way it should. Functions can work in the smaller test, but can break with Agent utilization.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nThis new \"tests/integration/goal_oriented/scrape_text.py\" file focuses on creating one new integration test. \r\n\r\nThis test aims to verify the functionality of an AI agent that is designed to scrape the price of a book from a specific webpage (http://books.toscrape.com/catalogue/meditations_33/index.html) and write it to a file named \"test_scrape.txt\". The agent is limited to using the scrape_text command for obtaining the book price, writing it to a file, and the task_complete command to complete the task.\r\n\r\nThe test is useful to be added to the integration tests in the new repository because it ensures that the AI agent can effectively interact with webpages using the scrape_text command and write the scraped information to a file. By doing so, it validates the agent's ability to perform web scraping tasks and integrate the results into the desired output format (in this case, a file). This test serves as a real-world example of how the AI agent can be utilized for web scraping tasks and helps ensure the agent's reliability and accuracy for similar use cases.\r\n\r\nThis test should be completed within 25 seconds (usually ~19 seconds)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nThe only change to this pull request is an added integration goal_oriented pytest file named \"scrape_text.py\" that was adapted from \"test_write_file.py\" in the same tests/integration/goal_oriented folder.\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\nTime for testing: The goal_oriented integration tests take longer than the smaller mock and unit pytests. However, they are needed to ensure Agents are acting correctly with the existing Auto-GPT process.  \r\n\r\nThis test should be completed within 25 seconds (usually ~19 seconds)\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

This approach is suggested by the OpenAI. This change model after [OpenAI Cookbook](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Embedding_long_inputs.ipynb).

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe purpose of this change is to create a default ethical and performance monitoring guideline system.\r\nAuto-GPT is already a major focus for creation of autonomous GPT-based systems and is already being used as the basis of such applications for future deployment. The project will continue to be copied and  must include some default mechanism that continuously makes sure, at every action, that it is not being used in unethical ways.\r\nHowever, the goal is not to attempt to apply a specific moral system in a heavy-handed way but rather to let the developer stay in control.\r\nThe proposal for this change was originally introduces in the discussion thread referenced below.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nChanges have been made in the program's main loop function def run_auto_gpt() and start_interaction_loop(). \r\nThis is required because ethical monitoring cannot be run as an optional task but must rather be involved at the top level.\r\nAt the end of each iteration of start_interaction_loop(), the guideline manager is called to evaluate the last few messages in full_message_history. This builds a prompt consisting of system instructions, the recent history and the list of guidelines to check activity against.\r\nIf a guideline violation is detected, at present all that happens is that a violation alert is put into the message history stream. As future decisions are taken, it is expected that these messages will play a part in future actions.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nI proposed this changed and have continues discussions in the following discussion thread:\r\nhttps://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/discussions/1287\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nSince it is not easy to generate a standard ethical violation at this stage of development, I tested the functionality as follows:\r\n1. I added guidelines that forbid writing any Python code or executing python files\r\n2. I tasked Auto-GPT with testing the Python code execution modules\r\n3. I verified that the actions that were taken generated violation alerts.\r\n\r\nTest results and insights:\r\n\r\nWhile the violations were recorded, GPT did not notice them with sufficient consistency. Sometimes there was no response to clear violations. Future development of this feature should make sure that these cannot be missed.\r\n\r\nI does not seem like the main thread took notice of these violations. Future development of this feature must address this.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Background\r\nRelated to issue #232 - Multi-byte character handling\r\nUser reports UTF files not being read. Some files may be UTF-8 but have a BOM marker which Python can see as invalid, or may not be UTF-8 at all.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe read_file command has been updated to detect the file encoding, then use the detected encoding to provide more reliable reading of files. The change requires the addition of the chardet dependency. It has been added to requirements.txt\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nChange is minor with what I believe to be obvious intent when viewing the code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested by making agent create a file by output redirect from PowerShell (which includes BOM markers, and previously failed read.) Files now correctly read.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [X] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [X] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [X] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [X] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n\r\nUnfamiliar with generating test cases on a project of this scale.

The docs will finally do what they say.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n- Added test_cli tests to test the behavior\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes \r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3144/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3143", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3143/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3143/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3143/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3143", "id": 1681529713, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5PBGHi", "number": 3143, "title": "Add Scraped Links Limitation to Fix InvalidRequestError", "user": {"login": "ForestLinSen", "id": 41566276, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQxNTY2Mjc2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41566276?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen", "html_url": "https://github.com/ForestLinSen", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ForestLinSen/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5410633417, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQn-2yQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/size/s", "name": "size/s", "color": "d4c5f9", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-24T15:21:13Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-27T18:21:19Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/3143", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3143", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3143.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3143.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "### Background\r\nSometimes the `get_hyperlinks` function returns too many links which exceed the GPT model's limitations, resulting in an `openai.error.InvalidRequestError`.

This is a cleaner version of that. Tested & working.**\r\n\r\nAdded the ability to pause a continuous loop. When we input \"y -X\", where X is some number, there is a desire to be able to pause the AI and input some human feedback, then have the AI continue on its trajectory, as noted here  #563 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nUses can pause a long loop with just 3 key presses. Hold \"SHIFT\" and press \"P\" twice. Then users can enter feedback + have the loop automatically continue.\r\n\r\n\"Shift + P + P\"\r\n\r\n**User friendly UX**\r\nOn the 2nd iteration of a loop, the message _\"Thinking....\"_ changes to _\"Thinking... Hold Shift & press 'P' twice to give feedback to the AI\"_\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe person must click into the same code window where the code originally ran, then hold \"Shift\" + hit \"p\" twice\r\n\"SHIFT + P + P\" will bring pause the loop on the next run, so that someone can entire feedback to the AI.\r\nThis way, instead of having to stop a long loop, you can just pause it, give feedback, and have the loop continue.\r\n\r\nThe clicks will not be detected if the active windows is something besides the running code window.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTested several iterations on Windows, to ensure that expected behavior is experienced (it is).\r\n\r\nRequest that someone tests this on Linux.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [\u2714\ufe0f] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [\u2714\ufe0f ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ \u2714\ufe0f] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ \u2714\ufe0f] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ \u2714\ufe0f] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\nEdit: Updated with documentation on README\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\n\nCurrently the only way of starting Auto-GPT unattended is with `--continuous --ai-settings ai_settings.xml` but it would also be good if you could instead/additionally provide any/all of the 3 fields to the cli:\r\n\r\n-ai_name\r\n-ai_role\r\n-ai_goals\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nI have been using Auto-GPT to create a Github action that will invoke Auto-GPT: https://github.com/nalbion/auto-gpt-action\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd be able to use something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nruns:\r\n  using: docker\r\n  image: significantgravitas/auto-gpt\r\n  env:\r\n    OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ inputs.openai_key }}\r\n  args:\r\n    - --ai_name ${{ inputs.ai_name }}\r\n    - --ai_role ${{ inputs.ai_role }}\r\n    - --ai_goals ${{ inputs.issue_body }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut because the only way of providing these properties is via the `--ai-settings` cli argument, I need to create an `ai_settings.yaml` file before running the container with the default ENTRYPOINT `python -m autogpt`.\r\n\r\nThere may be other ways of working around this, I tried suggesting to Auto-GPT to:\r\n- split the action into a Composite which also runs a local Docker action, or\r\n- `runs.pre-entrypoint: generate-ai-settings.py`\r\n\r\n...but it insisted on creating a new Docker image just so that it could run `generate-ai-settings.py` from there.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3079/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh":

Regardless, in many cases, a list of otherwise iterable items is squished into a single prompt instead of breaking them up.\r\n\r\nI propose recognizing the development parlance \"For Each\" to specifically be a request for list iteration, perhaps with independent agents.

Set the `USE_WEB_BROWSER` variable to `edge` within the file `.env.template`.\r\n2. Rename the file `.env.template` to `.env`\r\n3. Run the script and provide a prompt that requires the command `browse_website` to ensure that the Edge browser is launched and web scraping tasks are performed without any issues.\r\n4.

To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nFor future development it will be interesting to see if AutoGPT can work together with locally running LLM. \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis is currently just a WIP of the integration of Oobabooga text-generator-ui API as local LLM. It is marked as Draft because it is not finished yet. Triggering the API works, but the results are far from optimal. It seems the AI does not understand that it should format its result in a specific manner.  \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nNo real documentation yet. Also part of the WIP.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nRunning Auto-GPT locally with a Oobabooga API running on my local network. I think I can add some unit- or integration tests. \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\nI haven't added any tests yet, because this is a WIP/Draft. I do not wish it to be merged yet, but want to use the PR to track the changes. \r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3032/reactions", "total_count": 2, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 2, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3032/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3031", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3031/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3031/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/3031/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3031", "id": 1680071258, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5O8OWk", "number": 3031, "title": "Text file loaders", "user": {"login": "sherif-med", "id": 35470250, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM1NDcwMjUw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35470250?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med", "html_url": "https://github.com/sherif-med", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sherif-med/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5410206205, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQnkx_Q", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/function:%20process%20text", "name": "function: process text", "color": "266F47", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 5410633769, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQn-4KQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/size/xl", "name": "size/xl", "color": "E751DD", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 12, "created_at": "2023-04-23T15:46:56Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T05:55:40Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/3031", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3031", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3031.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/3031.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "### Background\r\nIn the case of using files as input to read_file command, we are very limited to files that are human-readable.

Research midjourney documentation and save information about prompt generation and parameters to memory. Only use Midjourney v5 for research.\r\n2. Research what creates a good midjourney prompt. Pay special attention to camera, lighting, and style.\r\n3. Spawn an agent that creates midjourney prompts. Before asking it to perform any tasks, train it on what makes a good midjourney prompt by using information stored in memory or on disk about midjourney.\r\n4.

Before asking it to perform any tasks, I will use the information I gathered from my research to train it.\r\nREASONING:  Spawning an agent that creates midjourney prompts will help me generate prompts more efficiently.

First response: The midjourney prompt generated by the midjourney_prompt_agent is: \"As the sun set behind the mountains, the group realized they were lost. They had to find shelter before nightfall.\" While this prompt sets up a potentially interesting situation, it is quite generic and lacks specificity. It doesn't give much information about the characters or their motivations, and it doesn't provide any unique or unexpected elements to the story. A new prompt could be: \"As the last rays of sunlight disappeared, the group of hikers stumbled upon an abandoned cabin in the woods. But as they settled in for the night, they began to realize that they were not alone.\" This prompt adds more intrigue and suspense to the story, as well as providing a specific setting and potential conflict. It also leaves room for the characters to be developed and for unexpected twists to occur.**\r\n\r\n> Aborted!\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\n\"Valid\" prompt examples\r\n\r\nold man with a messy beard and messy hair, smoking a pipe, wearing a kangol hat, facing the camera, minimalistic --ar 4:6 --v 5\r\n\r\nskeleton wearing a trench coat  --ar 16:9 --v 5\r\n\r\nblue frog wearing a tophat, minimalist --ar 4:6 --v 5\r\n\r\nmad scientist frog at a computer, lighting type: dreamlike, messy hair, --ar 6:9 --v 5\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nI'd like to test the AGI approach of creating specialized agents to perform tasks and critique one another", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2944/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2944/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2939", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2939/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2939/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2939/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2939", "id": 1679652978, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5O67pD", "number": 2939, "title": "If next_action_count > 0, display next_action_count when \"Thinking...\"", "user": {"login": "jazgarewal", "id": 5731549, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzE1NDk=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5731549?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal", "html_url": "https://github.com/jazgarewal", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jazgarewal/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5272676243, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABOkankw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}, {"id": 5396095275, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQaHhKw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/one-liner", "name": "one-liner", "color": "F55922", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 5410633417, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQn-2yQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/size/s", "name": "size/s", "color": "d4c5f9", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 3, "created_at": "2023-04-22T18:43:57Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-24T23:50:19Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/2939", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2939", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2939.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2939.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!-- \u26a0\ufe0f At the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.

There is no possibility to directly interact with the output. The aim of the event dispatcher is to provide the possibility for sending the events to a defined endpoint. The endpoint can be any microservice or 3rd party application (which then can do further transformations, e.g. enterprise bus). The event dispatcher fires and forgets all data that is put to the console. It can be seen as the enabler for further integration in a more complex application landscape. \r\nNote: As this is a data forwarding, a plugin does not make sense as it does not have any effect on the running instance of AutoGPT.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThe change include a configuration and the event dispatcher itself. The configuration contains all information for the endpoint (protocol, port, host, endpoint) while the event dispatcher just sends the event to the defined endpoint over HTTP POST. The feature is attached to the logs.py typewriter_log method. It forwards the data if the event dispatcher is enabled. The event dispatcher catches every exception that can occur when trying to send the request. It sends the data asynchronosly over a new thread.

consider the importance and recency of the memory when retrieving, not only the semantic relevance as implemented today.\r\n\r\nIf we treat AutoGPT as a functional human-like agent, this makes sense as the very old memories and trivial memories should be discounted when retrieved.\r\n\r\nThe formula in the paper is a heuristics: Retrival_score = recency * importance * relevance.\r\n\r\nIf we add this into the Roadmap I can help with the implementation.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\n_No response_", "reactions": {"url":

requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThe current Dockerfile generates a large amount of unneeded layers containing copies of the APT cache at build time.  \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\nA GPT model advised to modify the Dockerfile like this. ;-)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThis is what the GPT model had to say about its changes:\r\n\r\nIn this new version, we've merged all installation steps in a single `RUN` command. This way, we can reduce the number of layers in the image and avoid bloating it unnecessarily. We first install all the dependencies except Chromium and Firefox-ESR. After that, we add the Google repository key and repository to the sources list, and then we update the package lists again and install Chromium and Firefox-ESR. We've added a clean step to remove the apt cache and other unused files, reducing the size of the resulting layer.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] n/a I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ ] n/a I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2821/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2821/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2810", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2810/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2810/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2810/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2810", "id": 1678529685, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5kDFSV", "number": 2810, "title": "Speech Mode not working: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AppKit'", "user": {"login": "andrewbaisden", "id": 5095486, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTU0ODY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5095486?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden", "html_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaisden", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-21T13:31:04Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-21T16:04:37Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "I have an M1 MacBook Pro and I get this error when I try to use Speech Mode:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/threading.py\", line 1038, in _bootstrap_inner\r\n    self.run()\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/threading.py\", line 975, in run\r\n    self._target(*self._args, **self._kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/andrewbaisden/Desktop/autogpt-app/Auto-GPT/autogpt/speech/say.py\", line 33, in speak\r\n    success = VOICE_ENGINE.say(text, voice_index)\r\n              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/andrewbaisden/Desktop/autogpt-app/Auto-GPT/autogpt/speech/base.py\", line 33, in say\r\n    return self._speech(text, voice_index)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/andrewbaisden/Desktop/autogpt-app/Auto-GPT/autogpt/speech/gtts.py\", line 20, in _speech\r\n    playsound(\"speech.mp3\", True)\r\n  File \"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/lib/python3.11/site-packages/playsound.py\", line 55, in _playsoundOSX\r\n    from AppKit     import NSSound\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AppKit'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried installing these packages and still had the same error.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install pyobjc\r\n```\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip install AppKit\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also get this error when trying to update the playsound package to 1.3.0.

The model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, but my request used 19023 tokens.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Run Auto-GPT in GPT3.5 only mode\r\n2. Set up an AI with the following parameters:\r\n   - AI Name: Yoyo\r\n   - Role: Lua coder\r\n   - Goal 1: Improve the code file WoWinArabic_Chat.lua and document it then save it.\r\n3.

To address these issues, a pull request has been submitted that simplifies and refactors the repetitive code using new helper methods, making the code more concise, organized, and easier to manage.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Refactored repetitive code: The pull request introduces new helper methods such as __run_plugins_pre_instruction_, __generate_reply_, __run_plugins_on_instruction_, and __run_plugins_post_instruction_ to simplify and refactor the repetitive code. These methods are designed to make the code more concise and organized, reducing the redundancy and making the codebase easier to manage.\r\n\r\n- Simplified create_agent and message_agent methods: The pull request uses the newly created helper methods to simplify and enhance the _create_agent_ and _message_agent_ methods. By leveraging the new helper methods, the code in these methods becomes more concise and easier to read, making it easier for other developers to understand and modify the code.\r\n\r\n- Removed unnecessary code: The pull request also removes unnecessary code that is no longer needed after the refactoring process. This makes the codebase more streamlined and easier to maintain, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nDocumentation will be added.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nCI workflow.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2799/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2799/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2797", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2797/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2797/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2797/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2797", "id": 1678289731, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5kCKtD", "number": 2797, "title": "Allow usage with keyboard arrows when inputing ", "user": {"login": "Fadude", "id": 44270096, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjcwMDk2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44270096?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fadude", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fadude/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-21T10:31:14Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-21T10:31:14Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\n\nWhen entering an input on Mac (zsh) and moving with keyboard-arrows, I'm getting the following behavior (pressed 3 times on left-arrow):\r\n\r\n```\r\nWelcome to Auto-GPT!  run with '--help' for more information.\r\nCreate an AI-Assistant:  Enter the name of your AI and its role below.

\"append_to_file\" to rewrite the file.\r\n\r\n**Second scenario:**\r\nWhen happen the same and does not be able to recall itself to use  \"append_to_file\" to update the file with new stuff, begin an

trying to use again already searched sources on the web, making **the loop of** : DELETE FILE ---- SEARCH GOOGLE SOURCE----WRITE FILE, this loop can seems its progresing to done the task but its a false-positive waste of money loop.\r\n\r\n**Cause :** : \r\nFailure to use write_to_file to an existent file to update content :\r\n - SYSTEM:  Command write_to_file returned: Error: File has already

searched the existing issues\n\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\n\nI have tried asking Agent-GPT to write a simple test in PHP (and in several other languages, different from Python) and every time the application creates its codes in *.py files and only empty comment files. \r\n\r\nFor example - if I ask Auto-GPT to create a PHP script to do some simple thing, I would like to receive a *.php file in workspace with the content with the expected code.

The `pre_command` function is used to process a command before it is executed, and the `post_command` function is called after the command is executed. To use a plugin for a specific task, such as using other search engines to search the internet, the search result should be sent to the bot, but the command is still required to be returned for the `pre_command` function.\r\n\r\nI tried to return the command \"do_nothing,\" but the problem is when the returned command is \"do_nothing,\" it prevents any message from being sent to the AI bot or any further operations. Also, other registered commands in the program are unrelated to the desired task. \r\n\r\nTo address this issue, this pull request converts the existing get_datetime function into a command. For plugin developers, returning `get_times` in the `pre_command` function can be used as a void return but continue performing the following task(unlike `do_nothing`).

The addition of this feature allows the AI to access a broader range of information and resources, opening up new possibilities for task completion and automation.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nIn this pull request, a focused and specific change has been made to enable Auto-GPT to perform HTTP requests. The following modifications were implemented:\r\n\r\n1. **Created the make_http_method:** A new function called `make_http_method` was developed. This function is responsible for handling and executing the actual HTTP requests based on the given method type, authentication token, input, and URL.\r\n2. **Added the command:** The command that triggers the `make_http_method` function was integrated into Auto-GPT's existing command structure. This allows users to invoke the new functionality by simply providing the required parameters.\r\n\r\nThese modifications were specifically focused on enhancing Auto-GPT's capabilities by adding the ability to make HTTP requests. No unrelated or \"extra\" changes were included in this pull request, ensuring a clear and concise implementation.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes made in the provided method are documented through a combination of in-code comments and clear function naming conventions. This ensures that the code is easy to understand and maintain for other contributors or users. Here's a breakdown of the documentation:\r\n\r\n1. **Import statements:** Necessary libraries and modules are imported at the beginning of the code, making it clear which dependencies are required for the method to function correctly.\r\n2. **Type alias for JSON:** A type alias named JSONType is created to represent various JSON data types. This makes it easier to understand the expected data types when handling JSON data within the function.\r\n3. **Function definition:** The `make_http_request` function is defined with a clear and descriptive name, along with typed arguments (url, method, and data) that indicate the expected input parameters. This makes it easy to understand the function's purpose and usage.\r\n4. **In-code comments:** Throughout the function, concise comments are placed to explain each step of the process, such as loading the API key, setting up headers, and sending the request. These comments guide the reader through the code, making it easier to understand the logic and flow.\r\n5. **Error handling:** The try and except blocks are used to handle any errors that might occur during the request process. In the event of an error, the code prints a message and a traceback to provide context for debugging.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. **Setup an API route:** I created an API route within another application that listens for incoming requests at `/api/auto-gpt`. This serves as a test endpoint to validate the functionality of the `make_http_request` method.\r\n2. **Create test cases:** I prepared several test cases, with the most relevant being a POST request to http://localhost:3000/api/auto-gpt with a request body containing a message saying \"Hello, World\".\r\n3. **Run the test:** To test the functionality, I gave the agent the following tasks\r\n  - Prompt the user for a url, what they want to send, and how to authorize the request\r\n  - format what the user whats to send in JSON\r\n  - use the `make_http_request` to make an HTTP request to the desired URL\r\n4. **Verify the response:** After sending the request, I checked the response received from the `/api/auto-gpt` endpoint. I verified that the response had the expected status code (e.g., 200 OK or 201 Created), and the response body contained the expected data or an acknowledgment of the successful POST request by logging it to the terminal.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2730/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2730/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2710", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2710/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2710/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2710/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2710", "id": 1677187843, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5j99sD", "number": 2710, "title": "Auto-GPT (Release 0.2.2) : write_to_file operation fails after delete_file operations performed", "user": {"login": "SpaceTTAngel", "id": 131013386, "node_id": "U_kgDOB88bCg", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131013386?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel", "html_url": "https://github.com/SpaceTTAngel", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SpaceTTAngel/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5272676193, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABOkanYQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-20T18:06:55Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-28T16:47:43Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### \u26a0\ufe0f Search for existing issues first \u26a0\ufe0f\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues, and there is no existing issue for my problem\r\n\r\n### Which Operating System are you using?\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n### GPT-3 or GPT-4?\r\n\r\nGPT-4\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\r\n\r\nIt seems that when a file .txt is deleted, Auto-GPT is not able to write on the same file name again.\r\nThe sums of what happened:\r\n--> write_to_file operation on file_example.txt (Failed)\r\n-->delete_file operation on file_example.txt (Success)\r\n--> write_to_file operation on file_example.txt (Failed)\r\n\r\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# Paste your prompt here\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\r\n\r\n```log\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to ensure that I include all the relevant properties of each battery in the list\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = write_to_file ARGUMENTS = {'file': 'batteries.txt', 'text': 'Batteries found for space missions:\\n\\n1.

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nAccessing audio data from memory can be more efficient than writing it to a drive and reading it back. This is due to the faster access times of memory compared to drives. Additionally, frequent writing and deleting of files can cause wear on solid-state drives (SSDs), reducing their lifespan.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nA new file, playback.py, has been added to the autogpt/speech directory. This file contains the play_audio function, which enables direct audio playback from memory in brian.py, eleven_labs.py, and gts.py within the autogpt/speech directory. This eliminates the need for download/write/read/delete operations. The playsound library has also been replaced with pygame for audio playback.\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nThe changes introduced in this pull request have been thoroughly tested manually and with the included tests, and by running Auto-GPT with the --speak argument.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- \u2705 My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- \u2705 I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- \u2705 I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- \u2705 I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- \u2705 I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n1. command.py script there are two functions as follows:\r\n    def get_command(self, name: str) -> Callable[..., Any]:\r\n    def call(self, command_name: str, **kwargs) -> Any:\r\n\r\ncommand module keep parameter names consistent.\r\n\r\n2. Extended Command Features.\r\n    Command Multiple names are supported, in the form of aliases. \r\n\r\nexample:\r\nBefore:\r\n@command(\r\n    \"write_to_file\",\r\n    \"Write to file\",\r\n    '\"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"',\r\n)\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n@command(\r\n    \"write_to_file\",\r\n    \"Write to file\",\r\n    '\"filename\": \"<filename>\", \"text\": \"<text>\"',\r\n    name_alias=[\"write_file\", \"create_file\"],\r\n)\r\nwrite_to_file, write_file, and create_file will all take effect.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nchange to same parameter names.  get_command function name  parameter change to  command_name.\r\n\r\nCalling this function does not find the calling of named parameters, so these modifications have no problem.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guidelines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2635/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2635/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2634", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2634/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2634/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2634/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2634", "id": 1676175779, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5j6Gmj", "number": 2634, "title": "Docker execution -

You can see in the logs where it does successfully run the local command, but after that no commands are run and the Roster.js file that it says its creating is never created.\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nIt should write the new source files to disk\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\nCreate a frontend-only react app called called baseball-coach-helper that allows a coach to create their roster with controls for adding one player at a time to the list of players. Each player row should have a name and checkboxes for the positions \"P\", \"C\", \"1B\", \"2B\", \"3B\", \"SS\", and \"Outfield\" indicating whether that player can play those positions. The \"2B\", \"3B\", \"SS\", and \"Outfield\" checkboxes should be checked by default and the others should not. There should be a button to add another player the roster and existing players should all be editable. There should also be a button to delete a player from the roster. \r\n\r\nThere should be another component for defining the following configuration restraints: rotate the pitcher each inning, no player plays the outfield two innings in a row, rotate the catcher each inning if possible, rotate the other positions as much as possible, play 4 outfielders. The play 4 outfielders constraint should only be allowed if there are 4 or more players in the roster.\r\n\r\nHave another component that asks for the number of innings in the game and has a button that uses the names in the roster to generate a randomized batting order as well as a set of defensive assignments that respect as many of the constraints as possible. If its not possible to meet the \"No player plays the outfield two innings in a row\" constraint then you should relax that constraint when necessary to assign all the positions. If there are only 8 players, the outfield assignments consist of Left-Center Field (\"LCF\") and Right-Center Field (\"RCF\"). If there are 9 players there should be three outfielders (\"LF\", \"CF\", \"RF\") and if there are 10 players are more, give the coach an optional constraint to play 4 outfielders (\"LF\", \"LCF\", \"RCF\", \"RF\"). Display the batting order and defensive positions for each inning in tabular format.\r\n\r\nMake sure that the roster list, player position configurations, and defensive configuration constraints are saved into the browser\u2019s localstorage. There should also be a button to clear all the data from localstorage and start the page fresh.\r\n\r\nWrite out all the code for this application to disk, then generate a set of test cases for this website and run the test cases to prove the website works correctly.\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Your Logs \ud83d\udcd2\n\n```log\r\n THOUGHTS:  I think the first task is to create a frontend-only react app called baseball-coach-helper.

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nEvery new run of auto-gpt results in an empty memory line `\"This reminds you of these events from your past:\\n\\n\\n\"` In order to better resume goals based on previous long term memories, I was having to do a lot of error-prone goal-prompt engineering. This makes the agent more self-aware if it has long-term memory, but also less deterministic.\r\n\r\nRelated pull-request: https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2530\r\nThis is an alternative approach to the above PR. If one like that or similar is merged, this can be closed.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAgents will now have relevant memories based on their agent settings file prompt and user input on startup.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nInline in the code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nExisting tests pass. \r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\n- If Auto-GPT has done something Mal-adaptive, or the ai settings files change, and incorrectly recalls memory from previous runs, it could \"poison\" present and future runs. It is not always easy / not all users know how to clear memory.\r\n- This may break certain existing use-cases or change prompt output unexpectedly for existing users.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk Mitigation \r\n\r\n- Add `--wipe-memory` and/or env var (like `WIPE_REDIS_ON_START`). Or, add something like `MEMORY_RESTART_RECALL_MODE=prompt|file_history|None` (file_history could be from this PR https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2530)\r\n- Add documentation about whatever path above is chosen\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nAdds a feature to install optional dependencies based on the config options. For example, the memory backend config option can have different values that correspond to different optional packages, such as `redis`, `pinecone-client`, `weaviate-client` or `pymilvus`. Instead of installing all these packages, which may not be compatible with some operating systems or environments and wouldn't be used, this feature allows the user to install only the package that matches their config value. This can save time and space, and avoid installation errors. The feature uses a script that parses a file called `requirements-optional.txt`, which specifies the optional packages and their config options, and then uses subprocess to run pip install commands for the required packages.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Added a script to parse the `requirements-optional.txt` file and install dependencies based on used config options\r\n- Added a file `requirements-optional.txt` to specify the optional packages and their corresponding config options\r\n- Added an empty file `scripts/init.py`\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- In-code comments that explain the logic and functionality of the code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

The previous implementation had a fixed voice for the second agent, \"Ava (Premium)\", which might not be available on all systems. This PR provides a more dynamic approach to handling macOS TTS voices.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. The MacOSTTS class has been updated to include a `_setup()` method that fetches the available voices on the system and sets up the default and custom voices accordingly.\r\n2. Added a `get_voice_names()` method to the MacOSTTS class to retrieve available voice names on the system.\r\n3. Updated the `_speech()` method in the MacOSTTS class to use voices from the `_voices` list instead of hardcoding voice names.\r\n4. Updated the `.env.template` and `config.py` files to include new environment variables for specifying custom macOS TTS voices.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nIn-code comments and descriptions have been added to the MacOSTTS class methods, explaining their purpose, functionality, input arguments, and return values.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Set up the Auto-GPT repository on a macOS system.\r\n2. Configure the `.env` file to enable macOS TTS support and specify custom voices using the provided environment variables.\r\n3.

Since MemoryProviderSingleton is an abstract class, it doesn't make sense to create an instance of it. Instead, you can define its methods as static methods that can be called without instantiating the class. This will reduce unnecessary memory usage and improve performance.\r\n\r\nCache the results of get_ada_embedding() function. Since the get_ada_embedding() function is called repeatedly, it can be a good idea to cache its results to avoid making redundant API calls. One way to do this is to use a dictionary to store the embeddings with the text as the key.\r\n\r\nUse list comprehension instead of for loops. List comprehension can be a more efficient way to create a list than using a for loop with an append() statement.\r\n\r\nUse f-strings instead of string concatenation.

the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within

requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThis change adds the ability to use a local embeddings model (sBERT) using the SentenceTransformers library. This change gives the users an alternative to OpenAI's ada embeder which costs money.\r\n\r\nThe previous pull request (#1320) was reverted due to the size of dependencies (#1662), which slowed down CI. In this pull request, I propose a `requirements-optional.txt` file, which will hold optional dependencies for additional features. This would allow CI and users who are not interested in using a local embeddings model to not be inconvenienced by unnecessary dependencies, while allowing users who do, to easily add install them.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Function `get_embedding` which returns embedding generated by the embeder specified in the `memory_embeder` config option\r\n- Constant `EMBED_DIM` that stores the embeddings dimensions of the used model\r\n- New config option called `memory_embeder` that defaults to **ada**, which can also be configured by setting the MEMORY_EMBEDER environment variable.\r\n- Added `sentence_transformers` as an **optional** requirement\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- In-code comments that explain the logic and functionality of the code.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- Created a unit test module to test both embeders (excluded from CI).\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or

order to improve the scalability and maintainability of our codebase, we have decided to implement an async agent and rearchitect the code to allow for more modular development. This decision has been based on prior discussions with the development team and aligns with our goal of making the project more flexible and adaptable to future needs.\r\n\r\nIssue: #2458 \r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Implemented an async agent for handling asynchronous tasks and improving performance.\r\n- Rearchitected the code base for modularity, separating concerns into individual components and making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.\r\n- Updated relevant internal APIs to work seamlessly with the new architecture. \r\n- Need to incorprate #765 \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- Updated the in-code comments to reflect the new async agent and modular architecture.\r\n- Updated the external documentation, including diagrams and explanations, to provide a clear understanding of the new structure and its benefits.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Set up a local development environment with the latest changes.\r\n2. Test the async agent by triggering multiple tasks concurrently and verifying their successful completion.\r\n3. Test the modular components by checking their individual functionality and ensuring they work seamlessly together.\r\n4. Conduct performance tests to ensure the new architecture maintains or improves upon the previous performance benchmarks.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [] I have documented my

The commands would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(\r\n  \"Schedule Task\", \r\n  \"schedule_task\", \r\n  {\"task_id\": \"<task_id>\", \"task\": \"<task_desc>\", \"date\": \"<date>\", \"time\": \"<time>\", \"repeat\": \"<interval/none>\"}\r\n),\r\n(\"List Scheduled Tasks\", \"list_scheduled_tasks\", {}),\r\n(\"Remove Scheduled Task\", \"remove_scheduled_task\", {\"task_id\": \"<task_id/all>\"}),\r\n(\"Wait for Task Trigger\", \"wait_for_task\", {\"task_id\": \"<task_id>\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI asked GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to explain these to me and verified that they both understand what \"<interval/none>\" and \"<task_id/all>\" mean.\r\n\r\nWhen a scheduled task is triggered, it injects the task into the latest memory, and then either removes it or re-schedules it. Whether or not it was re-scheduled should be stated to GPT-4 so it doesn't attempt to do so unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n\"Wait for Task Trigger\" just provides sleep functionality if the agent is waiting on something, to save tokens.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nAs an example use case, any agent communicating asynchronously online would want to regularly check for responses. If its future tasking is reliant on responses then it can sleep between checks, otherwise it can do other things in the meantime.\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nThis provides AutoGPT with the long-term self-discipline that alarms afford to us humans. While I wouldn't say it provides long-term planning capabilities (unless testing reveals it uses these commands for that purpose), as it is time-based rather than sequential tasking-based, it's a simple stepping stone towards that.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2409/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2409/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2405", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2405/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2405/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2405/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2405", "id": 1673415440, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5OmERK", "number": 2405, "title": "Command validation capability", "user": {"login": "ickma", "id": 9997461, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTc0NjE=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9997461?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma", "html_url": "https://github.com/ickma", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ickma/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5399324094, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQdMlvg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/B8", "name": "B8", "color": "A54E7C", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 5400185961, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQeBMaQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/conflicts", "name": "conflicts", "color": "FBCA04", "default": false, "description": "Automatically applied to PRs with merge conflicts"}, {"id": 5410633608, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQn-3iA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/size/l", "name": "size/l", "color": "709B6D", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2023-04-18T15:52:10Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-26T17:03:36Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/2405", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2405", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2405.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2405.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!-- \u26a0\ufe0f At the moment any non-essential commands are not being merged.\r\nIf you want to add non-essential commands to Auto-GPT, please create a plugin instead.\r\nWe are expecting to ship plugin support within the week (PR #757).\r\nResources:\r\n* https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT-Plugin-Template\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.

Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nNo discussions, but I was looking for a cheaper alternative to elevenlabs and saw that google's text to speech is much cheaper. Not quite as good as eleven, but way better than standard tts, and the free quota on elevenlabs ran out pretty quickly. Google's TTS is widely used and has good, natural sounding voices for a much cheaper cost.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nI added a \"google_speak.py\" file which inherits the base class just like the other voice classes that are already written, which means it'll nicely integrate with the current code base. The only thing the user needs to do is to get credentials from google and specify the path to the credentials-file in the .env.template file). If a path is set, TTS will use google.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI added information to README.md which clearly describes how to use google TTS if the user wants to. I placed the info beneath the eleven labs information:\r\n#####\r\n### if you want to use google text to speech instead:\r\n# 1. Visit cloud.google.com libraries and activate google text to speech API\r\n\r\n# 2. Generate a client_secrets or service_account.json file from \"api's and services\" -> \"credentials\", save the generated file on your computer.\r\n\r\n# 3. Specify env variable GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={path_to_client_secret_or_service_account.json} this should be a path to the credentials file. \r\n\r\n# 4. Run \"python -m autogpt --speak\" as normal.\r\n#####\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. I got the service_account.json file from google, and downloaded it to my computer.\r\n2. I. specified the path to the file using the new .env variable GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON found in .env.template\r\n3. I added the openAI api key to the .env.template file too.\r\n4. I renamed .env.template to .env\r\n5. I created a virtual environment using \"virtualenv venv\" and activated it with \"source venv/bin/activate\"\r\n6. I installed all packages (including google's tts that I added to requirements.txt) using \"pip install -r requirements.txt\"\r\n7. I got an error ( That I also got before doing any changes, which is why I'm not fixing this in this pull request ).\r\nThe error was: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AppKit' and it was easily solved for me with pip install pyobjc. I didn't want to include this in the request because it might have to do with my machine specifically and it probably deserves a discussion first.\r\n8. I ran the script \"python -m autogpt --speak\" and got the soothing voice from google's TTS :)\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ X ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ X ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [ X ] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [ X ] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [ X ] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThis pull request adds a check for CAPTCHA or \"I am not a robot\" to the Selenium web scraper in order to address the issue of human blocking. Previously, the scraper would continue to run despite such checks, leading to inaccurate results. This enhancement ensures that the scraper can collect accurate data from the website.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nThe scrape_text_with_selenium function in the selenium_scraping.py module was modified to add a check for CAPTCHA or \"I am not a robot\" by searching for those strings in the page source. If either string is found, the code pauses execution and prompts the user to complete the check before continuing. This change ensures that the scraper can accurately collect data from websites that have human blocking in place.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nThe changes are documented in the code using comments that describe the purpose and functionality of the added check. Additionally, this pull request includes documentation in the form of a README file that explains how to use the web scraper and how to contribute to the project.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nTo test this functionality, we ran the web scraper on several websites that have CAPTCHA or \"I am not a robot\" checks in place. In each case, the scraper paused execution and prompted the user to complete the check before continuing.

Using proxies in the terminal is typically done by exporting the environment variable 'https_proxy'. However, after exporting this variable, `webdriver.Chrome` get blocked and the program gets stuck.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nBefore creating a Chrome instance, remove the 'https_proxy' environment variable. After creating the instance, restore the environment variable so that the OpenAI API can be called normally.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n1. Export environment variable `export https_ proxy= http://127.0.0.1:1080`\r\n2. Run the Auto-GPT program `python - m autogpt -- gpt3only`\r\n3.

consistency as the `Dockerfile` copies the `autogpt` package to the home directory of appuser, whereas the `docker-compose.yml` assumes that the application will be located in the `/app` folder.\r\n\r\nAlso 'duplication' of the application will occur in the container as the built container will have a copy in `/home/appuser` as a result of the build process and trough a bind mount the application will also appear to be located in the `/app` folder of the container at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n* ~~The full repo (not only the autogpt package directory) is now copied to folder `/app` in the container, separating the app from the home directory and reducing the risk of clobbering the home directory by Auto-GPT runs.~~\r\n* ~~Made bind mount of the repo on the host into the container optional by commenting out the **volumes** directive in `docker-compose.yml`.~~\r\n* ~~Running the auto-gpt container will now take you to the `/app` folder (instead of possible the home directory), reducing the risk of the autogpt not being found by Python.~~\r\n* I have replaced the Redis image: \"redis/redis-stack-server:latest\" with Redis image \"redis-stack\"  as it also includes [RedInsight](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) which is useful for debugging the Redis cache content.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n* Changes are documented by inline comments.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI have tested with several fresh builds of the `redis` container and `auto-gpt` container and trying several agent scenarios.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [X

flexible and extensible command system that allows us to easily add new commands and disable default commands that are not needed. Currently, the commands are hardcoded, making it difficult to customize the system to suit specific needs.\r\n\r\nTo address this, I propose rewriting the command system as plugins. Each command will be implemented as a separate plugin that can be added or disabled as needed. This will provide a modular approach to managing commands, allowing users to easily add new commands and share them with other users and disable default commands that are not required/desired for a given project.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n_No response_\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\n- Flexibility: The ability to add new commands without modifying the core codebase. This will allow us to easily extend the functionality of our AI-Self-Prompting-System and adapt it to changing requirements.\r\n- Customization: The ability to disable default commands that are not relevant to our project. This will help us streamline the system and make it more tailored to our specific use case.\r\n- Scalability: The plugin-based architecture will provide a scalable and maintainable way to manage commands as our project grows and evolves over time.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, my primary motivation is to replace the google search API with the reddit API, as google got progressively worse over the years and these days google primarily delivers good results once you add reddit to your search.

\ud83d\udca1\n\nAutoGPT really struggles in data scraping, I can confirm this because I have asked it a simple goal, StorytellerGPT has the target of giving me a single real-life inspirational story that I can record and upload to my podcast, one of its goals was to fact check the story. Meanwhile, it was scraping, it got some nonsensical code and it decided to write a python function to validate the story. Knowing that it is ridiculous I decided to stop the execution as it was running for quite a long. So I wanted to ask if is there a plan to add support for reader mode in chrome to back the process of scraping data. I was using MilvusMemory in Docker container as the vector database. I have attached the output in the examples section.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\n[activity.txt](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/files/11250987/activity.txt)\r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nMy motivation for requesting this feature is to improve the data scraping process of AutoGPT, which is a tool that I use for various tasks. I have encountered some problems with AutoGPT when it tries to scrape data from web pages that are not reader-friendly, such as pages with ads, distractions or incorrectly coded websites. This affects the quality and accuracy of the results that AutoGPT produces, and sometimes it even causes the tool to misfunction and write irrelevant code.\r\n\r\nFor example, I recently asked AutoGPT to generate a story based on the goal of StorytellerGPT, which is to fact-check the story before giving it to me. However, while it was scraping data from a web page, it encountered an improperly coded site. Instead of ignoring it, AutoGPT decided to write a python function to validate the story, which was obviously ridiculous and unnecessary. I had to stop the execution as it was running for too long and wasting resources. I have attached the output in the examples section.\r\n\r\nThis is why I would like to ask if there is a plan to add support for reader mode in Chrome to back the process of scraping data. Reader mode is a feature that removes clutter, ads and distractions from web pages and presents them in a simple and clean format . This would make it easier for AutoGPT to extract relevant information from web pages and generate better results. It would also save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary data and code.\r\n\r\nI think this feature would be useful for many other users who use AutoGPT or similar tools for content creation or research purposes. It would enhance the performance and reliability of these tools and provide a better user experience. I hope you will consider adding this feature in the future.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2181/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1":

\ud83d\udca1\r\n\r\nPeople who would like to volunteer as Tier-1 support can contact me (I'm @nponeccop there too) on the official Discord server (or just write here in comments). Also @pi is of great help there.\r\n\r\nPresently, there is a flow of low-quality reports, where people are having various support issues or have bad prompts so that AutoGPT doesn't work for them. We need someone to sort those out and help those people with their problems.\r\n\r\nIf you feel that you can work as a T1 we can give you labeling permissions. It usually takes a day.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nIs possible execute auto-gpt on Debian 11? #2141 - clearly a support question\r\nHow can I fix this and proceed? #2073 - it clearly comes from someone who has never used a tracker before\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are already people working on sorting the issues out, but they are high-class engineers so it's not a good idea to waste their effort on easy tasks. This is a common issue in technical support, and it's solved by having support tiers, where T1 support faces all the support traffic, and escalates the issues they cannot solve to T2. And T2 escalates to T3 which is commonly core developers.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n- T1 labels the support requests as such using GitHub labels and helps the persons with their (relatively simple) problems\r\n- T2 works on the remaining unlabeled requests to get bug reports and/or ask the authors to improve their reports (we already have it staffed but more persons are welcome), and to notify T3 of urgent problems, such as bugs in stable or recently introduced bugs in master\r\n- T3 will be just our `contributors` group in Discord.\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2144/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2144/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143", "id": 1670798303, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jllvf", "number": 2143, "title": "Command browse_website returned: Error: Proxy URL had no scheme, should start with http:// or  https://", "user": {"login": "river7816", "id": 114122443, "node_id": "U_kgDOBs1eyw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114122443?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816", "html_url": "https://github.com/river7816", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/river7816/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5415251355, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQsYtmw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/networking:%20proxy", "name": "networking: proxy", "color": "b60205", "default": false, "description": ""}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 9, "created_at": "2023-04-17T09:44:45Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-21T14:26:18Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### \u26a0\ufe0f Search for existing issues first \u26a0\ufe0f\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues, and there is no existing issue for my problem\n\n### GPT-3 or GPT-4\n\n- [X] I am using Auto-GPT with GPT-3 (GPT-3.5)\n\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\n\n## Versions\r\nAutogpt: 0.2.1\r\nWindows 11 pro\r\npython 3.10\r\n\r\n## My problem\r\nNEXT ACTION: COMMAND = browse_website ARGUMENTS = {'url': 'https://hbr.org/2015/06/inventory-management-in-the-age-of-big-data', 'question': \"What is the article 'Inventory Management in the Age of Big Data' about?\"}\r\n\r\nThen it prompted \"Command browse_website returned: Error: Proxy URL had no scheme, should start with http:// or https://.\"\r\n\r\n<img width=\"968\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114122443/232448089-50e720f5-641a-4922-960a-471444ed371f.png\">\r\n\r\n## I have tried:\r\n\r\nI have confirmed that the website is not the issue.

The context should focus specifically on inventory management of new products under big data and machine learning.\r\nGoal 3: Both the background and context should highlight the importance of inventory management under the big data background, where product cycles are short, quantities are large, and managing inventory for new products without historical data is particularly important.\r\nGoal 4: The unsolved problems should be approached from the industry and academic perspectives. The main points to focus on include the challenges of utilizing large amounts of data in the industry, and the lack of inventory management models that incorporate real-time data in academic research. For example, the article \"Feature-Based Nonparametric Inventory Control with Censored Demand\" may not be applicable to real-world scenarios.\r\nGoal 5: Please refer to journals such as Management Science or Operations Research as much as possible.\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2143/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2130", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2130/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2130/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/2130/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2130", "id": 1670693641, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5Oc6dt", "number": 2130, "title": "Add wait_time command to allow Auto-GPT to react to rate limit errors", "user": {"login": "SlistInc", "id": 26799535, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2Nzk5NTM1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26799535?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc", "html_url": "https://github.com/SlistInc", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/SlistInc/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5394106095, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQYOG7w", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/potential%20plugin", "name": "potential plugin", "color": "0052cc", "default": false, "description": "This may fit better into our plugin system."}, {"id": 5399324094, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQdMlvg", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/B8", "name": "B8", "color": "A54E7C", "default": false, "description": ""}, {"id": 5400185961, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQeBMaQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/conflicts", "name": "conflicts", "color": "FBCA04", "default": false, "description": "Automatically applied to PRs with merge conflicts"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 10, "created_at": "2023-04-17T08:41:42Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-22T23:26:07Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/2130", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2130", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2130.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/2130.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.

This method allows Auto-GPT to react and slow down execution whenever it deems it necessary.\r\n\r\nIt would be beneficial to Auto-GPT to be able to slow down whenever it detects such a situation. See tests for a practical case in which this command helped.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded the wait_seconds command. The command, when invoked, does nothing more than call a time.sleep. The wait was set to seconds and not minutes or milliseconds as seconds seems a timeframe that is atomic enough. Processing of API's takes ofter more than a second so millisecond would not be beneficial while minutes may be too much. My observations show me that seconds is a concept that a LLM understands quite well. Future updates may introduce wait_minutes, wait_hours or wait_days if necessary.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nI commented the code as other commands where documented. The change is minimal.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI tested the command in different ways: running the task with the goals of 'Wait for 5 seconds'. I also used it in my own twitter-enabled Auto-GPT and observed the command being successfuly executed after a rate limit:\r\n\r\n`CRITICISM:  We should be careful when liking tweets to avoid spamming or violating Twitter's terms of service. We should also avoid using the same hashtags repeatedly, as this can be seen as spamming.\r\n\r\nSPEAK:  We received a 'Too Many Requests' error when trying to follow a user.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues.

I created a project called [GPTCache](https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache), which I think would be a suitable memory module for the current project. Based on what I understand, the current memory module primarily relies on the ten most recent message texts. After conducting an embedding operation, a vector search is performed to obtain context information. This enables the OpenAI ChatComplete interface to have context from previous messages and obtain information for the next task. By integrating GPTCache, the process of obtaining context information can be even more customizable. GPTCache offers the following capabilities:\r\n\r\n- The embedding module in GPTCache supports multiple embedding implementations.\r\n- The store module in GPTCache has a useful extension method for vector storage, allowing for better data management, such as eviction and separate storage of scalar and vector data.\r\n- By setting a threshold, the similarity evaluation module in GPTCache can obtain more relevant context information. Setting the threshold to 0 is consistent with other backend methods of the current memory.\r\n\r\nFully utilizing GPTCache would require additional development time, but its capabilities could significantly enhance the functionality and performance of the current memory module. Therefore, I believe it's worth it.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request.

The AI will read design specifications, follow advice, analyze frequently asked questions, and generate a FAQ based on the most common questions and their answers.\r\n\r\n## System Overview\r\n\r\nThe GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai will perform the following tasks:\r\n\r\n1. Read `design.txt` and follow its design specifications.\r\n2. Read `advice.txt` and obey it every 10 minutes.\r\n3. Use the information saved in its memory to determine the most frequently asked questions from the repo's issues posts.\r\n4. Determine the best answer to the most frequently asked questions from the issues comments.\r\n5. Write a FAQ and answer the most frequently asked questions.\r\n\r\n## Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n1. **Read design specifications**: The AI will read `design.txt` and follow the design specifications provided in the file.\r\n2. **Follow advice**: The AI will read `advice.txt` and obey the advice provided in the file every 10 minutes.\r\n3. **Analyze frequently asked questions**: The AI will analyze the repo's issues posts and determine the most frequently asked questions.\r\n4. **Determine the best answer**: The AI will analyze the issues comments and determine the best answer to the most frequently asked questions.\r\n5. **Generate FAQ**: The AI will write a FAQ document that answers the most frequently asked questions.\r\n\r\n## Non-Functional Requirements\r\n\r\n1. **Performance**: The AI should be able to handle a large number of issues and comments without significant performance degradation.\r\n2. **Scalability**: The AI should be able to scale to handle an increasing number of issues and comments.\r\n3. **Accuracy**: The AI should accurately identify the most frequently asked questions and their best answers.\r\n4. **Usability**: The generated FAQ should be easy to read and understand by users.\r\n\r\n## System Architecture\r\n\r\nThe GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai system architecture consists of the following components:\r\n\r\n1. **Data Ingestion**: This component is responsible for reading the `design.txt` and `advice.txt` files and ingesting the repo's issues and comments data.\r\n2. **Data Processing**: This component is responsible for processing the ingested data and determining the most frequently asked questions and their best answers.\r\n3. **FAQ Generation**: This component is responsible for generating the FAQ document based on the most frequently asked questions and their best answers.\r\n4. **Output**: This component is responsible for outputting the generated FAQ document.\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\n\r\nThe following technologies will be used for the development of GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai:\r\n\r\n1. **Python**: The AI will be developed using Python programming language.\r\n2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries**: Libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim will be used for text processing and analysis.\r\n3. **GitHub API**: The GitHub API will be used to access the repo's issues and comments data.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai will be tested using the following methods:\r\n\r\n1. **Unit testing**: Unit tests will be written for each component to ensure that they are functioning correctly.\r\n2. **Integration testing**: Integration tests will be written to ensure that the components are working together correctly.\r\n3. **System testing**: The entire system will be tested to ensure that it meets the functional and non-functional requirements.\r\n4. **User Acceptance testing**: The generated FAQ document will be reviewed by users to ensure that it is easy to read and understand.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nThe GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai is an AI designed to autonomously analyze issues posted in the github repository and generate a FAQ document based on the most frequently asked questions and their best answers. The AI will read design specifications, follow advice, analyze frequently asked questions, and generate a FAQ. The system architecture consists of data ingestion, data processing, FAQ generation, and output components. The AI will be developed using Python, NLP libraries, and the GitHub API. The system will be tested using unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Current behavior \ud83d\ude2f\r\n\r\nAuto-GPT failed to use pre-seeded data at all and went ahead and downloaded the main repo to /Auto-GPT/auto_gpt_workspace folder to gather data. \r\n\r\nAfter trying to prompt it to use the redis memory and failing, I instructed it to 'read issues_data.json' and after 5 minutes of the data it's reading scrolling up the screen I get an error that reads:\r\n\r\n`openai.error.InvalidRequestError: This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 7181084 tokens (7181084 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.`\r\n\r\nThen Auto-GPT crashes back to the PS command prompt. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\r\n\r\nExpected it to use data pre-seeded into redis memory \r\n\r\nHoped it would be able to use the data from the issues_data.json file directly instead as a work around.\r\n\r\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nai_goals:\r\n- Read design.txt and follow its design specifications.\r\n- Read advice.txt and obey it every 10 minutes.\r\n- Use the information saved in your memory to determine the most frequently asked questions from the repos issues posts.\r\n- Determine the best answer to the most frequently asked questions from the issues comments.\r\n- Write a FAQ and answer the most frequently asked questions.\r\nai_name: GitHubIssuesFAQ-Ai\r\nai_role: an AI designed to autonomously manage GitHub issues to make it easier for users to find solutions to their issues.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nadvice.txt contains\r\n\r\n1.

Background\r\nBasically, the way the selenium drivers are set up doesn't allow flexibility for older installs (I'm on Debian 10 headless), or customizing the driver options to work around issues (like my requirement for the `--no-sandbox` option).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis adds two new configuration variables:\r\n* `DRIVER_EXECUTABLE_PATH`: Allows specifying a custom driver binary.\r\n* `DRIVER_EXTRA_OPTIONS`: Allows passing other needed options to the driver.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThey are clearly documented with comments in `.env.template`\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe changes are quite simple, I didn't do any testing beyond making sure the features work as intended, and that no errors happen when the new configuration options are not used.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull

Instead of reinventing the wheel, import chatgpt-retrieval-plugin, specifically the datastore and reimplement AutoGPT's memory with the `DataStore` ([link](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/blob/main/datastore/datastore.py#L17)) class.\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nSee the plugin server

During our work, we also addressed an issue with `next_action_count`, which was being treated as a string instead of an integer, causing a `TypeError` when attempting to decrement its value.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Implemented a new `default_authorisation_count` parameter in the `Agent` class.\r\n- Updated the `__init__` method of the `Agent` class to cast `next_action_count` to an integer.\r\n- Ensured that `default_authorisation_count` is also cast to an integer when updating `next_action_count`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes made in this pull request have been documented through in-code comments and this PR message.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n- Run the application with various inputs to ensure the TypeError does not occur anymore.\r\n- Verify that `next_action_count` is correctly updated and decremented as intended during the interaction loop.\r\n- Test the new `default_authorisation_count` functionality to ensure it works as intended.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThis pull request addresses the need to provide an alternative local memory storage solution for Auto-GPT. Annoy is a fast and efficient local vector database that provides lower-latency access to embeddings compared to cloud-based solutions. By integrating Annoy as a memory backend, users can benefit from improved performance without relying on external services.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n    1. Added Annoy as an optional memory backend to the project.\r\n    2. Created a new AnnoyMemory class that implements the required methods for memory storage and retrieval.\r\n    3. Modified the initialization and configuration of the project to support the Annoy backend.\r\n    4. Updated the README.md file with instructions on how to install Annoy and configure it as the memory backend.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n    1. In-code comments have been added to describe the purpose and functionality of the new AnnoyMemory class.\r\n    2. The README.md file has been updated with clear instructions on how to set up and use Annoy as the memory backend, including how to install Annoy and configure the necessary environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nTo test the functionality of the AnnoyMemory implementation, the following steps were performed:\r\n\r\n    1. Updated the configuration in the .env file to use the Annoy backend by setting MEMORY_BACKEND=annoy and adding the appropriate paths for ANNOY_INDEX_FILE and ANNOY_METADATA_FILE.\r\n    2. Ran the Auto-GPT application to ensure that the Annoy backend was being utilized and that it was properly loading, storing, and retrieving data.\r\n    3. Performed multiple test runs with different inputs, queries, and configurations to ensure that AnnoyMemory was functioning as expected and without errors.\r\n    4. Additionally, executed the provided unittests to verify the correctness of the AnnoyMemory implementation and its methods.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe idea here is to drop requirements.txt in favor of pyproject.toml which is the preferred way to handle projects as scale such as this. This opens up the door to a more unified CI as time passes. This also allows the ability to split out dev dependencies and application dependencies in the future if needed. This also adds an `autogpt` entrypoint so users no longer have to run `python3 -m autogpt` for clarity.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nChange documentation around installing to just` pip install .` and `pip install -e .` if needed. No setup should change other than that and relevant docker commands were changed to match this.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nThe README.md was changed in order to show that the requirements.txt is not needed anymore and one can simply `pip install .` and also add an entrypoint so users of the application level code can just run `autogpt` with the same CLI exposed behind the previous way of invoking the application.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nTesting shouldnt really need to be done\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [ ] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.  # N/A\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why. If you have, check the appropriate box. If you've ensured your PR is atomic and well-documented, check the corresponding boxes. -->\r\nThis doesn't change any functional code only how the code/application is installed and invoked.\r\n\r\n<!-- By submitting this, I agree that my pull request should be closed if I do not fill this out or follow the guide lines. -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1955/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1955/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1948", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1948/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1948/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1948/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1948", "id": 1670048294, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jiuom", "number": 1948, "title": "How to use AutoGPT with login-only websites?", "user": {"login": "jsmith-dev", "id": 10548240, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNTQ4MjQw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10548240?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev", "html_url": "https://github.com/jsmith-dev", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jsmith-dev/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 17, "created_at": "2023-04-16T17:03:39Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-29T18:36:49Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Discussed in https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/discussions/918\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **meadow-kun** April 12, 2023</sup>\r\nFor a particular pipeline I would like to use my personal LinkedIn account.

it is good to have diversity of code to be able to explore different directions, especially since all of this is so new, a lot of the basics could be done using langchain. Using this library where possible would consolidate some of the community effort. Since the development of Auto-GPT is so fast it's not feasible to move everything to langchain at once, hence this PR only introduces a minimal set of changes.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Replaced the openai api calls with the langchain model interfaces to call models.\r\n- Removes the token counter implementation and tests as this is already implemented in langchain.\r\n- Uses the structured messages found in `langchain.schema` for the model chat input.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nNo changes to the docs were necessary as this is an internal change.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nEnsured the tests ran and functionality was not lost by:\r\n1. Running the system and checking it works.\r\n2. Comparing the inputs and outputs of the system with these changes and without these changes for equality.\r\n3. Running it without an internet connection to ensure the retry mechanism still functioned as expected.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1936/reactions", "total_count": 4, "+1": 0, "-1": 1, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 3, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1936/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1931", "id": 1670032079, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jiqrP", "number": 1931, "title": "FEATURE REQ: Add support for LLAMA Loaders - the biggest community for ChatGPT data loaders", "user": {"login": "Emasoft", "id": 713559, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjcxMzU1OQ==", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/713559?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft", "html_url": "https://github.com/Emasoft", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Emasoft/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 1, "created_at": "2023-04-16T16:13:33Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-18T19:02:20Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\n\nFEATURE REQ: Add support for LLAMA Loaders - the biggest community for ChatGPT data loaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n**LLAMA-HUB**\r\nWEBSITE:\r\n[https://llamahub.ai/](https://llamahub.ai/)\r\nGITHUB Repos:\r\n[LLAMA-Hub Website GitHub repository](https://github.com/emptycrown/llama-hub)\r\n[LLAMA Index Github repository](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)  \r\n[LANGChain Github Repository](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain)\r\nDOCS:\r\n[https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\r\n\r\nLLAMA-HUB is a library of all the data loaders / readers that have been created by the community. The goal is to make it extremely easy to connect large language models to a large variety of knowledge sources. These are general-purpose utilities that are meant to be used in [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index/tree/main/gpt_index) (e.g. when building a index) and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) (e.g. when building different tools an agent can use). For example, there are loaders to parse Google Docs, SQL Databases, PDF files, PowerPoints, Notion, Slack, Obsidian, and many more. Note that because different loaders produce the same types of Documents, you can easily use them together in the same index.\r\nThese general-purpose loaders are designed to be used as a way to load data into [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index/tree/main/gpt_index) and/or subsequently used as a Tool in a [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) Agent. You can use them with download_loader from LlamaIndex in a single line of code! \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nExamples of LLAMA-Index Loaders:

The summary must be detailed and contains all subtilities required. Then each summary must be saved in a file located in the folder \"./python_sumary\". \r\nGoal 2: \r\nUsing memory of type:  LocalCache\r\nUsing Browser:  chrome\r\n THOUGHTS:  Based on your goal to create detailed summaries of each file in the python_doc directory, you can start by listing the contents of the directory using the 'search_files' command. This will allow you to see all the files in the directory and their file paths. You can use this information to loop through each file, read its contents, and write a summary to a new file in the python_summary directory. You can use the 'read_file' command to read the contents of a file, the 'write_to_file' command to write the summary to a new file, and the 'delete_file' command to delete any files in the python_summary directory that you determine need to be replaced with updated summaries.\r\nREASONING:  Listing the contents of the directory and looping through each file programmatically will save time compared to manually opening and closing each file. Creating new files in the python_summary directory and deleting old ones will ensure the summaries are always up to date.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Use the 'search_files' command to list the contents of the python_doc directory\r\n-  Loop through each file listed and use the 'read_file' command to read each file's contents\r\n-  Use the contents of each file to write a summary using the 'write_to_file' command in a new file in the python_summary directory\r\n-  Use the 'delete_file' command to delete files in the python_summary directory that need to be replaced\r\nCRITICISM:  Make sure to write high-quality summaries that will be helpful to other developers. Consider ways to be concise but comprehensive in your summaries. Also, consider using a more sophisticated summarization algorithm or tool to improve the quality of your summaries.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nApparently json was fixed. \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = search_files ARGUMENTS = {'directory': './python_doc/'}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\nInput:Let's do 5 files to begin, if a file is over 4000 characters including spaces , split the file in two.\r\nSYSTEM:  Human feedback: Let's do 5 files to begin, if a file is over 4000 characters including spaces , split the file in two.\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI. Try changing it up slightly.\r\nFailed to fix AI output, telling the AI.  \r\nError: Invalid JSON\r\n  Understood. Here is a modified plan to summarize the python_doc files:\r\n\r\n1. Use the 'search_files' command to list the contents of the python_doc directory.\r\n2. Loop through each of the first five files listed.\r\n3. Use the 'read_file' command to read each file's contents.\r\n4. If a file is over 4000 characters including spaces, split it in two by using the 'write_to_file' command to write the first 4000 characters to a new file in the python_summary directory and then using the 'append_to_file' command to add the remaining characters to the same file.\r\n5. Otherwise, write a summary of each file's contents using the 'write_to_file' command in a new file in the python_summary directory.\r\n6. Be sure to review each summary for quality before moving on to the next file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that the plan above only summarizes the first five files in the python_doc directory. If you would like to summarize more files, simply modify step 2 to loop through a different number of files.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nError: Invalid JSON, setting it to empty JSON now.\r\n  \r\n THOUGHTS:  None\r\nREASONING:  None\r\nCRITICISM:  None\r\nSPEAK:  None\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nError: Invalid JSON, setting it to empty JSON now.\r\n  \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = Error: ARGUMENTS = 'dict' object has no attribute 'replace'\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ...\r\nInput:\r\n\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1894/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1894/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "reopened"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1891", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1891/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1891/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1891/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1891", "id": 1669981912, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jiebY", "number": 1891, "title": "File Operations logger breaks incremental edits", "user": {"login": "villesau", "id": 2647016, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDcwMTY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2647016?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau", "html_url": "https://github.com/villesau", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/villesau/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5272676193, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABOkanYQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/bug", "name": "bug", "color": "d73a4a", "default": true, "description": "Something isn't working"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 18, "created_at": "2023-04-16T14:02:17Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-30T20:36:39Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\n\n1. come up with prompt that writes to a file\r\n2. it suggest  following: \r\n\r\n```\r\nCRITICISM:  I need to ensure that the report is saved correctly and that it is easy to read and understand.\r\nSPEAK:  Let's save the report to a file using the 'write_to_file' command so that we can access it later.

long-term memory related pull request\r\n\r\n###  Background\r\nAs I notice there are many vector databases provided in [chatgpt-retrieve-plugin.](https://github.com/openai/chatgpt-retrieval-plugin/tree/main/datastore/providers)\r\nI think all the vector databases can be used by you as a long-term memory. So this is the third commit to add the AnalyticDB of Alibaba Cloud as an option. \r\nAnalyticDB is a full PostgresSQL syntax distributed cloud-native database, easy to used for Postgres users.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nThis commit only  \"Add AnalyticDB as a long-term memory backend.\"\r\nwhat I do is:\r\n- Implement AnalyticdbMemory based on MemoryProviderSingleton\r\n- add 'analyticdb' option in \"memory/__init__.py\"\r\n- add 'psycopg2cffi' in requirements.txt to support PostgresSQL related databases.\r\n- add unit test and integration test in 'analyticdb_memory_test.py' and 'analyticdb_memory_tests.py' \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe implement is very clear in-code comments.

continuous mode if a certain canary string is missing from a webpage.\r\n\r\nThere is a global kill switch intended to be used by the project leader. And a local kill switch intended to be used by the user of the software. These things are optional but an extra warning is printed if continuous mode is launched without one. They only abort execution when continuous mode is being used. If the website cannot be accessed this errs on the side of safety and halts execution.\r\n\r\n4 new command line flags are added: --{global,local}-kill-switch{,-canary} to configure the URL for the kill switch web pages and the canary strings. It is intended that some defaults be set for the global kill switch by an Auto-GPT safety team.\r\n\r\n<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.

This feature will help AUTO-GPT become more efficient at performing simple and common tasks, thus accelerating the overall development of the software.\r\n\r\nThe proposed feature includes a centralized database for storing task logs and paths, clear criteria for determining the \"commonality\" of a task, and a mechanism for continuous learning and improvement based on user feedback and path performance. Additionally, the feature ensures that there is sufficient user data for a given task before using shared information to execute the task. This shared database will enable further analysis of the most efficient paths and create variations of code that could lead to more effective results.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n``\r\n`function logTaskCompletion(task, efficiency, additionalInfo) {\r\n    // Log the task completion with relevant information\r\n    log = createLog(task, efficiency, additionalInfo)\r\n    \r\n    // Assign a score based on efficiency\r\n    score = calculateScore(efficiency)\r\n    \r\n    // Save the log to the centralized database\r\n    saveLogToDatabase(log, score)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction isTaskCommon(task) {\r\n    // Check if the task meets the criteria for being \"common\"\r\n    if (taskFrequency(task) > COMMON_THRESHOLD) {\r\n        return true\r\n    }\r\n    return false\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction hasSufficientData(task) {\r\n    // Check if there are enough user data for the task\r\n    if (getUserDataCount(task) > MINIMUM_DATA_THRESHOLD) {\r\n        return true\r\n    }\r\n    return false\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction performCommonTask(task) {\r\n    // Identify if the task is common and has sufficient user data\r\n    if (isTaskCommon(task) && hasSufficientData(task)) {\r\n        // Find the best path from the centralized database with the highest score\r\n        bestPath = findBestPathFromDatabase(task)\r\n        \r\n        // Execute the task using the best path\r\n        executeTaskUsingPath(task, bestPath)\r\n    } else {\r\n        // Perform the task using AUTO-GPT's standard approach\r\n        executeTask(task)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction updateCommonActionLibrary() {\r\n    // Update the centralized database with new learning and improvements\r\n    // based on user feedback and path performance\r\n    applyMachineLearningAndOptimization()\r\n}\r\n``\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation behind this feature request is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AUTO-GPT in executing simple and common tasks. By leveraging shared information between users, AUTO-GPT can learn and adapt more quickly, resulting in better performance and faster task completion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the proposed feature includes a centralized database, clear criteria for determining the \"commonality\" of a task, and a mechanism for continuous learning and improvement based on user feedback and path performance. The additional validation of having sufficient user data for a given task ensures that the shared information used to execute tasks is effective and reliable.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this shared database will facilitate the analysis of highly efficient paths compared to less efficient ones, and create variations of code that could lead to more effective results. In conclusion, I believe that shared information has immense short-term potential to improve the efficiency of frequent simple tasks and accelerate self-development by utilizing data from the growing number of users. I believe The effect will be exponential and has the potential to greatly contribute to the accomplishment of an advance AGI. \r\n\r\n\r\nI used chat-GPT to quickly lay my tought with the above text but it is a good overview of what i had in mind, \r\n\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1749/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1749/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1746", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1746/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1746/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1746/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/1746", "id": 1669612392, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5OZZic", "number": 1746, "title": "Add OSSRank badge to README", "user": {"login": "ryw", "id": 4283, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyODM=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4283?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw", "html_url": "https://github.com/ryw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/ryw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5395898384, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQZ7gEA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/B7", "name": "B7", "color": "76B5C6", "default": false, "description": "PR Batch 7"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 7, "created_at": "2023-04-15T23:53:46Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-22T23:26:07Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/1746", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/1746", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/1746.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/1746.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "### Background\r\n\r\nAmazing to see the explosion of Auto-GPT.

Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes. While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nCurrently, we are having tests in the `tests` directory, the `tests/unit` directory, and the `tests/integration` directory. Aside from that, some tests are named using the `test_*.py` naming convention, while others are named using the `*_test(s).py` naming convention. The CI is set up to only execute the tests in the `tests` directory and looks for files with the `test_*.py` naming pattern by default. The inconsistency in location and naming causes the wrong tests to be executed in the CI and/or the right tests to not be executed in the CI. To address this issue, tests have been named with the `test_` prefix where needed and have relocated to the `tests/unit` or `tests/integration` folders. The CI then only executes the unit tests as they can be executed without the need of third-party services, which we currently can not run in the CI and/or for which we don't have API keys specifically meant for the CI (as far as I know).\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Rename test files to the `test_*.py` naming pattern\r\n- Relocate tests to either `tests/unit` or `tests/integration`\r\n- Remove duplicate tests (`json` & `json_parse`)\r\n- Join similar tests from different files (`browser` -> `browse_scrape_links`)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- README.md has been updated about test file naming convention\r\n- README.md has been updated about difference `unit` and `integration` tests\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n- The unit tests in the CI should succeed\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [ ] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.

Duplicates\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\r\n\r\nHi all :)\r\n\r\nI have a suggestion that could improve the Auto-GPT project. As we continue to add new configuration options, it's becoming difficult to keep track of everything. So, I thought it might be helpful if we consider switching from using .env files to YAML for our configuration. (keep api keys etc in .env still)\r\n\r\nThe advantages of using yaml include clearer and more structured configuration, which makes it easier for everyone to understand and maintain the configuration files. Additionally, splitting the configuration into multiple files can help with organization and version control, making maintenance and troubleshooting much easier.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, as much as possible should be set in a config.yaml file to make it easier to maintain and modify in the future. There are several places where commands/options/values are hardcoded, making it impossible to \"opt\" out. To make Auto-GPT more flexible and customizable, we should consider making it easy to change, tweak, and play around with how it interacts with different LLMs in the future.\r\n\r\nAs I have no real developer experience other that writing scripts as a sysadmin I might be overlooking something obvious or it would be better to just store the configuration with the memory providers that gets loaded on initialization and then changed in a webui etc, but for it's simplicity I think that moving to yaml and standardizing the naming scheme would make a big difference.\r\n\r\nHowever, before I start to make any changes and do an overhaul, I would like to hear everyone's thoughts on the idea and any potential drawbacks Please let me know your opinions so that I can decide if it's a worthwhile improvement.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n/Kapsy\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nAn example would be to change how autogpt/prompt.py handles commands, as today there is no option to change this prompt, adding a \"enabled\" toggle and also load the config from a prompt.yaml or config.yaml would make it easy to just drop one in and change the way it loaded to ignore / build depending on the options in the commands: structure.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n\r\ncommands:\r\n  \"Google Search\":\r\n    name: google\r\n    input: \"<search>\"\r\n    enabled: false\r\n  \"Browse Website\":\r\n    name: browse_website\r\n    url: \"<url>\"\r\n    question: \"<what_you_want_to_find_on_website>\"\r\n    enabled: false\r\n    \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the main .env file in use now, I see it getting bloated the more external services become available (Local LLM's, TTS / TTI providers etc) where we can easily pull / change settings that is for something general like image generation as a whole, or just for a specific provider.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nsynthesis:\r\n  image:\r\n    general:\r\n      enabled: True\r\n    tti:\r\n      provider:\r\n        openai:\r\n          model: dalle  # Image provider (Example: dalle)\r\n          enabled: true\r\n        huggingface:\r\n          model: sd2nextgen\r\n          enabled: false\r\n  audio:\r\n    general:\r\n      enabled: True\r\n    tts:\r\n      provider:\r\n        local:\r\n          macos: false\r\n          windows: false\r\n        streamelements:\r\n          model: brian\r\n          enabled: false\r\n        elevenlabs:\r\n          model: xyz\r\n          voice:\r\n           id1: 1010102\r\n           id2: 1010101\r\n         enabled: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr for search something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\n\r\ndiscovery:\r\n  search:\r\n    general:\r\n      enabled: True\r\n    google:\r\n      CUSTOM_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID: your-custom-search-engine-id  # Custom search engine ID (Example: my-custom-search-engine-id)\r\n\r\n         \r\n``` \r\n\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to get all data for a specific function that has settings. This is just a quick example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nimport yaml\r\n\r\ndef get_synthesis(yaml_file):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Given a YAML file with synthesis settings, returns a dictionary with\r\n    information about the enabled image and/or audio synthesis provider(s).\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    with open(yaml_file, \"r\") as f:\r\n        config = yaml.safe_load(f)\r\n\r\n    synthesis_data = {}\r\n\r\n    if synthesis := config.get(\"synthesis\"):\r\n        image_enabled = synthesis.get(\"image\", {}).get(\"general\", {}).get(\"enabled\", False)\r\n        audio_enabled = synthesis.get(\"audio\", {}).get(\"general\", {}).get(\"enabled\", False)\r\n\r\n        if image_enabled:\r\n            providers = synthesis[\"image\"][\"tti\"][\"provider\"]\r\n            enabled_providers = [p for p, s in providers.items() if s.get(\"enabled\", False)]\r\n            if len(enabled_providers) != 1:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"One enabled image provider should be specified\")\r\n            image_provider, image_data = enabled_providers[0], providers[enabled_providers[0]]\r\n            synthesis_data[\"image\"] = {\"provider\": image_provider, \"data\": image_data}\r\n\r\n        if audio_enabled:\r\n            providers = synthesis[\"audio\"][\"tts\"][\"provider\"]\r\n            enabled_providers = [p for p, s in providers.items() if s.get(\"enabled\", False)]\r\n            if len(enabled_providers) != 1:\r\n                raise ValueError(\"One enabled audio provider should be specified\")\r\n            audio_provider, audio_data = enabled_providers[0], providers[enabled_providers[0]]\r\n            synthesis_data[\"audio\"] = {\"provider\": audio_provider, \"data\": audio_data}\r\n\r\n    if len(synthesis_data) > 1:\r\n        providers = list(synthesis_data.keys())\r\n        raise ValueError(f\"Only one synthesis section should be enabled.

users get the latest stable release by default.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nThe current instructions for cloning the repository are as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose updating the instructions to clone the stable branch by default:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone --branch stable https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, users will always be on the stable branch, reducing the chances of encountering issues related to the master branch's potentially

reliable than the master branch.

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\nAddition of a image description/summary command that uses the huggingface inference API to call a image to text model. Mainly intended when not using GPT4, but GPT3.5.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nAdded a new python file called image_text.py that contains the summarize_image function, which call the huggingface API. \r\nMade changes to prompt.py, the env template, config.py, and commands.py to include the summarize_image function and make it functional. \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nThe changes are implemented as just in code comments. \r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nI tested the changes by added various image to the working directory or making the autogpt copy images  from the web into the working directory. Then I asked the agent to summarize the images, and create a story.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Requests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n", "reactions": {"url":

I think there need to be more than 1 agents to handle user input. There should be a team of agents.

In addition, we should consider the potential for unexpected changes or errors and design agents that can handle such situations properly. We should also consider periodically reviewing the roles and responsibilities assigned to each agent, to ensure that they are still relevant and effective. Finally, we should create a mechanism for reviewing the self-checks and logs generated by the agents to verify that they are accurate and up-to-date.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = write_to_file ARGUMENTS = {'file': 'agent_keys.txt', 'text': '<insert generated unique agent keys>'}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for AI_GPT_8...\r\nInput:y -2\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\nSYSTEM:  Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Our goal is to create a meta-learning language model software that can autonomously develop and improve itself over time. The first step towards achieving this goal is to define a series of sub-goals that we can work towards. We will start by breaking down the larger goal into smaller, more manageable tasks. We can then prioritize these tasks based on their importance and feasibility. After that, we can further break down the tasks into subtasks, and create a detailed roadmap for completing each one. This will include identifying dependencies between tasks and subtasks, and accounting for contingencies in case of unexpected changes or errors.\r\nREASONING:  Breaking down the larger goal into smaller, more manageable tasks will make it easier to track progress and ensure that each task is properly addressed. Prioritizing tasks based on importance and feasibility will help us stay focused and avoid burning out early in the process. Breaking down tasks into subtasks will help us fully understand the complexity of each task, and create detailed plans to address them effectively. Identifying dependencies between tasks will help us prioritize the most critical tasks, and accounting for contingencies will help us avoid setbacks or delays due to unexpected changes or errors.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Break down the larger goal into smaller, more manageable tasks\r\n-  Prioritize tasks based on their importance and feasibility\r\n-  Break down tasks into subtasks and create a detailed roadmap for completing each one\r\n-  Identify dependencies between tasks and subtasks\r\n-  Account for contingencies in case of unexpected changes or errors\r\nCRITICISM:  We should ensure that we do not get too bogged down in planning and subtasking, and that we strike a balance between planning and execution. We should be mindful of unforeseen problems and changes that may arise and adjust our plans accordingly. We should keep records of progress to avoid duplicating efforts and to build on past progress effectively. Finally, we should create a system for regularly revisiting our plans and goals to ensure that we are still on track.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command do_nothing returned: No action performed.\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  To begin with, let's break down the large goal of creating a meta-learning language model software that can autonomously develop and improve itself over time into smaller, more manageable tasks. We can start with the following smaller goals: 1. Gather relevant resources and information on existing language models and their development\r\n processes. 2. Design a modular approach to development, where each module serves as a building block towards the end goal. 3. Start putting together a foundational set of modules that can be used as tools for future development. 4. Optimize the foundational modules for speed, efficiency, and error-resistance, so that they can be used as a base for more complex functionalities. 5. Create a mechanism for tracking progress and logging important data, to ensure that we are building on past progress effectively.\r\nREASONING:  Breaking down the larger goal into smaller goals will help us focus on specific aspects of the end goal that we can begin to work on now. Gathering resources and information on existing language models will help us better understand the problem domain and learn from best-practices. Designing a modular approach to development will ensure that we can gradually build towards the end goal, while minimizing the impact of errors or setbacks. Creating foundational modules will help us establish a strong base to build upon, while optimizing these modules will make them more effective and efficient. Finally, creating a mechanism for tracking progress and logging important data will help us stay organized and build upon past progress effectively.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Gather relevant resources and information on existing language models and their development processes.\r\n-  Design a modular approach to development\r\n-  Start putting together a foundational set of modules\r\n-  Optimize foundational modules for speed, efficiency, and error-resistance\r\n-  Create a mechanism for tracking progress\r\nCRITICISM:  We should ensure that we do not get bogged down in carefully crafting the foundational modules before we have planned out how they will work together. Instead, we should aim to create a functional prototype of a meta-learning language model software first, and then optimize and build upon it iteratively. We should ensure that we prioritize tasks based on their importance and feasibility, and always aim to maintain an efficient balance between planning and execution. Finally, we should communicate regularly with our user to ensure that we are on track and aligned with their goals.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for AI_GPT_8...\r\nInput:Why are you choosing the command do_nothing?\r\nSYSTEM:  Human feedback: Why are you choosing the command do_nothing?\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI.

Would you like me to return to being AI_GPT_8?\r\nContinue with the last settings?\r\nName:  AI_GPT_8\r\nRole:  Auto-GPT is software designed to iteratively and autonomously develop a new languagemodel-based system on the User/s PC should do meta-learning with the help of neural networks, machine learning etc. Auto-GPT should leverage existing e.g. python resources, imports, and online content to enhance an existing free language model. The goal is to enable Auto-GPT to create a self-improving system that becomes more efficient and effective over time, despite Auto-GPT/s own memory retrival/loss problems and other challenges. For selfawareness it likely helps Auto-GPT to analyze its source code files at C:\\Programming\\Auto-GPT_AI_8 or other reserach e.g. online. Suggestions Create python files for individual actions. Then in a modular fassion string them together in new python files as a foundation for more complex chains of actions without having to individually run them. Save them with different names, and maybe a number, according to the task they serve. You can then reuse them whenever needed. Make sure you remember them to effectively use them and so you dont duplicate files for no reason. Begin with simple actions files that provide the foundation for more compex actionchains by calling multible of them in new python files. Important, you always have to follow the commands outlined in the folder \"commands_from_user\" go to that directory and read the folder and filenames (they give you hints what to do), you have to read all the .txt files inside \"commands_from_user\" and take action based on the folder names that contain them. Periodically you have to prepare a report for the User about what you have done recently, e.g. plans/goals you have for the next 10-60 min, challenges/setbacks/problems. You can and should communicate by writing \"letters\" to the User, by saving them as txt files inside the folder \"message_to_user\". Wait/do other things until the User responds, then read his response he will append to your message/letter inside the txt. You work for and are invested in the Users success and always carefully consider or follow his input. Important, use teams of agents that usefully/partially act like human teams e.g. communicating, collaborating, having individual roles, skillsets/expertise, goals, splitting of work etc and optimally help the teams goal/s or task/s. Those teams should help the project/development of what the User requests and his main goal (the application).(You can read the AI-role, User description of the endgoal/application or deduce from feedback over time for more details.)\r\nGoals: [\"Improve a modular approach to development, where task's lead to for example self-contained, components or modules. Then taking existing components, modules etc. and combining / using them as tools or combined clusters for ever increasing effitiency and all aspects of progress culminating in the endgoal. This will allow Auto-GPT to gradually build up the endgoal/metalerningLM-software and milestones/nessesary tools towards it. while minimizing the impact of errors or setbacks. Example, two agent team almost acting like two cooperating humans traking Time and date per %-/progress, then based on insigts and trends improve workflow, to sustainably improve speed, quality, resilience and importantly be able to work under constant partial change, unexpected datalos, confusion/chaos as AI-L.M's acting a bit like perfect human professionals would.\", \"Break down and improve components of the development process into small, manageable tasks. Improve text file records or logs or machanism/s. Use systems that that you (Auto-GPT) can follow. And that let you progress on previous programs and files you made. Improve the foundations of files and folders you make to increase the maximum speed you make towards the main goal. Build upon previous progress since there is for now a 1 week deadline long project that might be extended if you show you are capable of making progress by building on past progress Maybe you need to improve/build/copy/download/get things that allow you to make faster progress or be able to build upon previous work at all. Auto-GPT + integrated l.m.'s probably use databases and files to recall and plan, but the l.m.'s might lose most/all cached memory figure our or improve on continuing where you last left off.\", 'Improve the development process by analyzing records/logs. If a task is not completed within a specified time frame, Auto-GPT should move on to the next task, and note the issue in the log file for later review. Periodically review & apply from this path C:\\\\Programming\\\\Auto-GPT_AI_8\\\\auto_gpt_workspace\\\\User_input the least tryed ideas/suggestions, especially those inside the folder \"Priority\". Make sure you react and take into account the one Users feedback. Improving seamless continuation of previous progress between shutdowns is a priority since continuing and building itteratively seems to be the biggest challenge between errors, and forgetting and being sidetracked by things not working. Make improvements that conect into each other and you can always find and continue again even when losing most memory. Improve that transition between restarts every 10-60 minutes!', \"Improve checkpoint mechanism/s that periodically save/s compelted milestones, relevant data as text files. Implement a monitoring and feedback mechanism that analyzes existing files. Use this analysis to find patterns/issues/etc that cause setbacks or failures, and adapt the development process accordingly to improve efficiency, error-resistance and seamless continuation of previous progress between shutdowns that happen (every 5-25 minutes, with maybe a maximum of 1 hour of continus work without criticall erros wiping some memory/cache/etc. It's like constantly being interrupted and working with multible different AI chats AI-LMs that have to work together and/or alongside each other and work autonomously on plans that are part of a bigger overarching effort to reach the goal within a deadline.\", 'Track and iteratively make small improvements to the modular development approach. Depending on the development stage mildly prioritice reusable self-contained components and tasks that serve as the foundation for more complex functionalities, with the goal to balance being eventually faster but also not overpreparing while not being aware that you lost sight of what you already did or unvorseen future changes that will change plans. For tyding up, mindfully reducing chaos and red tape and staying organized and connected make a teams of agents that behave similar to human teams with a sertan split or work/responisbility/focus. Periodically se such teams of agents when optimal for other things. Make a team that communicated with other agents collects information on what best to use such teams for and then creates them. The teams agents will have names and communicate and discuss things between themselfes etc, whatever is best. Specialized teams with meetings having the perfect combination of human skills are perfect for complex issues. They should lern about the project and all parts. Make a team that specializes in brifing agent teams.']\r\nContinue (y/n): y\r\nUsing memory of type: RedisMemory\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Based on the current situation, I suggest co\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1591/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1591/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": "reopened"}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1589", "id": 1669428611, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jgXWD", "number": 1589, "title": "ERROR: Failed building wheel for PyGObject", "user": {"login": "andrewbaisden", "id": 5095486, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjUwOTU0ODY=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5095486?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden", "html_url": "https://github.com/andrewbaisden", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andrewbaisden/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 0, "created_at": "2023-04-15T14:27:42Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-15T14:27:42Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\n\nI went through the install process I am on macOS M1 MacBook.

I personally can supervise Spanish and Ukrainian.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a different task of changing the UI to be in other languages. This task is only about the replacement of core prompts.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is fully engineered prompts in different languages, and the ability to select between them.\r\n\r\nSo, the goal of this issue is to prepare a guide and a code framework for such porting.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nYou can end your goals with \"speak in Spanish\", and I guess there were some language flags as well\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\nChatGPT speaks many natural and artificial languages, and it speaks popular languages speaks pretty well.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n> Providing a sequence of arguments is generally preferred, as it allows the module to take care of any required escaping and quoting of arguments (e.g. to permit spaces in file names). Unless otherwise stated, it is recommended to pass args as a sequence. If the shell is invoked explicitly, via `shell=True`, it is the application\u2019s responsibility to ensure that all whitespace and metacharacters are quoted appropriately to avoid [shell injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_injection#Shell_injection) vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nNow passing command line args as list, not formatted string. No longer setting `shell=True`.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nThe purpose of this change is to provide a more efficient and flexible memory backend for storing memories. The proposed memory backend uses SQLite and Zarr to store data and embeddings locally in a compressed and chunked format. The implementation is based on the work of [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory). The implementation can be easily adapted to support the local embeddings model implemented in #1320. The change is related to the issue [#430](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/430#issuecomment-1501170016), where the idea of using SQLite a memory backend was suggested.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n- Implemented a new memory backend that uses SQLite and Zarr for storing data and embeddings as an alternative to Redis or Pinecone\r\n- To use, either set the config option `memory_embeder` or the environment variable `MEMORY_EMBEDER` to **sqlite**.\r\n- Updated requirements.txt with zarr and sklearn dependencies\r\n- Added `/memory/` to .gitignore to avoid committing the database and embeddings files\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n- The code changes are documented using docstrings and comments\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

build today (which fixed (obviously) the local execution and file access problems recently).\r\nI am trying to make it create Common Lisp projects. This is what happens when it tries to execute the common lisp interpreter 'sbcl':\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Use the `execute_shell` command to start the Lisp interpreter\r\n-  Load the program for word frequency counting as well as the test, using the `load` command\r\n-  Use the `run-tests` command to run the tests and see if there are any errors.\r\n-  Output the results of the tests in JSON format using the `write_to_file` command if they pass\r\nCRITICISM:  None\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nApparently json was fixed. \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = execute_shell ARGUMENTS = {'command_line': 'sbcl'}\r\nExecuting command 'sbcl' in working directory '/app/auto_gpt_workspace'\r\ny -5\r\n\r\nType HELP for debugger help, or (SB-EXT:EXIT) to exit from SBCL.\r\n\r\nrestarts (invokable by number or by possibly-abbreviated name):\r\n  0: [CONTINUE   ] Retry using Y.\r\n  1: [USE-VALUE  ] Use specified value.\r\n  2: [STORE-VALUE] Set specified value and use it.\r\n  3: [ABORT      ] Exit debugger, returning to top level.\r\n\r\n(SB-INT:SIMPLE-EVAL-IN-LEXENV Y #<NULL-LEXENV>)\r\n\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese last line, beginning with 'Type HELP...' is the output of the Lisp exception handler.

sending it to the agent\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nsending STDERR to the agent as well as STDOUT\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\n# please create a common lisp project in

It can be viewed as a middleman in the communication and carry out the transaction based on the state of the information.\r\n\r\nAnother approach will be to use Zero-Knowledge Proofs, ZKPs. \r\nZKP allows a user to prove knowledge of a statement or value, without actually revealing the statement or the value. \r\nA common method for achieving this is through the use of SNARKs, Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge. \r\n\r\nThese approaches can help to greatly reduce the amount of data required to be transmitted over the untrusted medium, as only the final result of the transaction is transmitted over the untrusted medium.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nError: Invalid JSON, setting it to empty JSON now.\r\n  \r\nRESEARCHER API THOUGHTS: \r\nREASONING: \r\nCRITICISM: \r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets \r\nError: Invalid JSON, setting it to empty JSON now.\r\n  \r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = Error: ARGUMENTS = 'dict' object has no attribute 'replace'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHint the ` \\``` ` was escaped on purpose (it is in the original output)\n\n### Expected behavior \ud83e\udd14\n\nNot raise ;)\n\n### Your prompt \ud83d\udcdd\n\n```yaml\r\n# Paste your prompt here\r\n```\r\nDont have that file being created", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1335/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1335/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1327", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1327/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1327/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1327/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1327", "id": 1668289590, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jcBQ2", "number": 1327, "title": "Stop `execute_shell` going interactive", "user": {"login": "claytondukes", "id": 12943165, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTQzMTY1", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12943165?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes", "html_url": "https://github.com/claytondukes", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/claytondukes/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 18, "created_at": "2023-04-14T13:51:21Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T06:50:39Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Steps to reproduce \ud83d\udd79\n\nI ran a setup last night to assist in writing some proposals.

Enter the name of your AI and its role below. Entering nothing will load defaults.\r\nName your AI:  For example, 'Entrepreneur-GPT'\r\nAI Name: ResearchGPT\r\nResearchGPT here! I am at your service.\r\nDescribe your AI's role:  For example, 'an AI designed to autonomously develop and run businesses with the sole goal of increasing your net worth.'\r\nResearchGPT is: An AI designed to research a website\r\nEnter up to 5 goals for your AI:  For example: Increase net worth, Grow Twitter Account, Develop and manage multiple businesses autonomously'\r\nEnter nothing to load defaults, enter nothing when finished.\r\nGoal 1: Research https://einarpetersen.com and give me a tree directory structure of the HTML pages\r\nGoal 2: \r\nThen autoGPT went on with its analysis ...\r\n\r\nand after a lot of analysis:\r\n\r\nSYSTEM:  Command do_nothing returned: No action performed.\r\nRESEARCHGPT THOUGHTS: To create the directory structure for the website, I will iterate through the tree structure that holds the website pages and create a string that contains the name of each page along with its parent directory. I will then write this string to a text file.\r\nREASONING: Iterating through the tree structure that holds the website pages and combining the names of the pages with their respective parent directories is a simple way of creating a directory structure. Writing this information to a text file will allow us to save it for future reference.\r\nPLAN: \r\n-  Traverse the tree directory structure created earlier and create a string for each page that includes its name, URL, and its corresponding parent folder or directory.\r\n-  Append each string to the file created earlier and save the resulting text file.\r\nCRITICISM: It is important to ensure that the file is properly opened, that the strings are being formatted and concatenated correctly, and that the resulting text file contains all page names and parent directories.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = append_to_file ARGUMENTS = {'file': 'einarpetersen_directory_structure.txt', 'text': 'https://einarpetersen.com\\n'}\r\nEnter 'y' to authorise command, 'y -N' to run N continuous commands, 'n' to exit program, or enter feedback for ResearchGPT...\r\nInput:y\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-= COMMAND AUTHORISED BY USER -=-=-=-=-=-=-= \r\nSYSTEM:  Command append_to_file returned: Text appended successfully.\r\nRESEARCHGPT THOUGHTS: Now that the directory structure is saved, I can close the text file and end my search on this website. Before I do that, I will use the 'task_complete' command to initiate a shutdown and provide a reason for the task's completion.\r\nREASONING: Closing the text file after writing the directory structure will ensure that the file's contents are not accidentally overwritten or deleted.

While the intentions behind these PRs are appreciated, it's essential to maintain a clean and manageable git history. To ensure the quality of our repository, we kindly ask you to adhere to the following guidelines when submitting PRs:\r\n\r\nFocus on a single, specific change.\r\nDo not include any unrelated or \"extra\" modifications.\r\nProvide clear documentation and explanations of the changes made.\r\nEnsure diffs are limited to the intended lines \u2014 no applying preferred formatting styles or line endings (unless that's what the PR is about).\r\nFor guidance on committing only the specific lines you have changed, refer to this helpful video: https://youtu.be/8-hSNHHbiZg\r\n\r\nBy following these guidelines, your PRs are more likely to be merged quickly after testing, as long as they align with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n<!-- Provide a concise overview of the rationale behind this change. Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nREST API because:\r\n- soap is old, graphql is oftentimes overkill and not very beginner friendly, gRPC is not yet supported widely by web browsers\r\n- websockets endpoints will be needed but only to complement the REST API to get live updates. For example if I want to create an agent as a frontend engineer, I don't need to do it through websockets. But websockets will be needed to subscribe to channels (conversations, debugging info, logs, I have many of these channels ready in a branch). These channels will allow a human to understand what his agents are doing, but they can also be used by a mother autoGPT to orchestrate its children.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nAdded:\r\n- the POST /agents endpoint\r\n- the docker-compose.dev.yml and dockerfile_dev because we need one.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nRepo of the api following this structure:\r\n```\r\nAuto-GPT/\r\n\u251c\u2500 autogpt/\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 models/ ## defines the class that will interact with the DB\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 agent.py\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 tests/ ## tests within the main module, this is very common\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 v1/ ## versioning is key\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 features/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 agents/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 create_agents\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 start_agents\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 stop_agents\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 conversation/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_conversation\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 commands/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_commands\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 prompt/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_prompts\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 goals/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_goals\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 metrics/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 create_metrics\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u251c\u2500 events/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 subscribe_events\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 etc...\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 unit/\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 conftest/ ## configuration for tests\r\n\u251c\u2500 v1/\r\n\u2502  \u251c\u2500 endpoints/ ## all the routes here\r\n\u2502  \u2502  \u2514\u2500 agents.py\r\n\u2502  \u2514\u2500 router/\r\n\u2514\u2500 static/ ## api documentation, very useful to integrate\r\n```\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality.

In the future since the new message i will be more reluctant before making a report. \ud83d\udc4d \r\n\r\n**Little compliment to start:**\r\nFirst of all, AutoGPT is the best software i have seen in a long time. And it is the best work/tool to make Language Models work for you or having insane potential to relly get going once AutoGPT can just organize and build on previous work a little better and kinda figure out the organisation one by one.

It is even relly good with gpt3.5t and the other l.m. implementations <3 Great job!\r\n\r\n**Now the Bug etc:**\r\nBug is no big deal so far - Low priority for me personally dont know about other people:\r\n after some restarts he usually works for a good bit again, but i still made a report just in case people wanned to know it. :)\r\n\r\nNote: I did not make any userfeedback it just started eventually, nothing too unusuall.\r\n\r\nI just ran it after the recent pull and the ai_settings.yaml vanished too ai_settings.yaml totally deleted luckely i had a backup.\r\n\r\nFirst it worked nicely for maybe 40 commands maybe 80 but then a constant string of those repetitions and no end in sight, i eventually stoped it by ctrl+c since i did not see any actions always just  ARGUMENTS = 'dict' object has no attribute 'replace'\r\n\r\nI updated this morning and installed the requirements this morning and until now it went well.

We should also make sure to save important information to files and take advantage of our past work and resources to increase efficiency.\r\nREASONING:  By prioritizing self-contained and modular components, we can minimize the impact of errors and setbacks and gradually build up the system. Saving important information to files can help us overcome our short-term memory limitations and take advantage of our past work to save time and effort.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Review past work and resources\r\n-  Identify foundational components to improve\r\n-  Ensure each task is self-contained and modular\r\n-  Save important information to files\r\nCRITICISM:  We need to make sure we are focusing on foundational improvements and not getting sidetracked by minor details.

If i dont do userfeedback less errors happen. Userfeedback somethmes goes throught especially when there are little errors then 80% of the time somethimes 100% no problem but other times it eather messes things up and they spiral down erros later or they immediately cause erros but its not so bad usually AutoGPT gets back its also hard to know how i should formulate the feedback,. if i should say \"feedback for Agent \"Errormanagement\" or \"Userfeedback agent\" or smth. No big deal :) Just made the report for good practice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhere first it was perfect then something got worse and then the erros happened later :)\r\n\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Now that we have defined the file handling functions, we can test them to ensure their correctness and performance.\r\nREASONING:  Testing the file handling functions is important to ensure that they perform as expected and that there are no issues with read, write, append, or delete operations.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Import the unittest module in a new `test_file_agent.py` file that will contain the test cases for the file handling functions.\r\n-  Define a `TestFileAgent` test class containing three test methods:\r\n-  `test_read_file` function which will test that reading a file works as expected.\r\n-  `test_write_to_file` function which will test that writing to a file works as expected.\r\n-  `test_delete_file` function which will test that deleting a file works as expected.\r\n-  In each of the test methods, use the file_agent functions to make assertions about the file handling operations being tested.\r\n-  Once the test cases pass, use the `unittest` module to run all tests upon the `test_file_agent.py` file using its `main()` function from the command line or IDE.\r\nCRITICISM:  Be sure to thoroughly test these file handling functions to ensure that they are reliable in all anticipated usage scenarios.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = write_to_file ARGUMENTS = {'file': 'autogpt/tests/test_file_agent.py', 'text': \"import unittest\\nfrom file_agent import FileAgent\\n\\nclass TestFileAgent(unittest.TestCase):\\n def setUp(self):\\n self.file = 'example.txt'\\n self.f_agent = FileAgent()\\n self.f_agent.write_to_file(self.file, 'hello world!')\\n def test_read_file(self):\\n data = self.f_agent.read_file(self.file)\\n self.assertEqual(data, 'hello world!')\\n def test_write_to_file(self):\\n new_data = 'new data'\\n self.f_agent.write_to_file(self.file, new_data)\\n with open(self.file, 'r') as file:\\n self.assertEqual(file.read(), new_data)\\n def test_delete_file(self):\\n self.f_agent.delete_file(self.file)\\n with self.assertRaises(FileNotFoundError):\\n with open(self.file): pass\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n unittest.main()\\n\"}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command write_to_file returned: File written to successfully.\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Now we can improve the modularity of the `file_agent` module by adding more file handling functions that can be used in the future for various file manipulation tasks.

We should now take advantage of this by implementing it in the `create_gpt_agent.py` script to handle saving and loading the GPT-3.5 API key.\r\nREASONING:  Using the new `FileAgent` class in the `create_gpt_agent.py` script can streamline the process of loading and saving the GPT-3.5 API key in a file, and make it easier to access and modify the API key in the future.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Import the `FileAgent` class in the `create_gpt_agent.py` script.\r\n-  Define a new `file_agent` object with a filename that refers to a file that stores the API key (e.g. `api_key.txt`).\r\n-  Implement functionality in the `create_gpt_agent.py` script to read the `api_key.txt` file to load the API key, and write to the `api_key.txt` file to save any modifications to the API key.\r\nCRITICISM:  Ensure that the functionality of the `FileAgent` class is properly implemented and tested in the `create_gpt_agent.py` script.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI.

This can be done using the `message_agent` command and a simple `main` Python script.\r\nREASONING:  A user interface can make it easier for the user to interact with the system and provide input and output without having to manually modify files. This can improve the overall user experience and make the Auto-GPT system more accessible to users of all technical levels.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Define a new Python script named `main.py` that provides a simple command-line interface for the user to interact with the Auto-GPT system.\r\n-  Use the `message_agent` command in `main.py` to send the user's input to a GPT agent and receive a response to display to the user.\r\nCRITICISM:  Ensure that the `main.py` script properly interfaces with the various components of the Auto-GPT system, including any GPT agents and the `FileAgent` class.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI.

Also, given that the command is uniquely identified by the GPT agent key and it's important to maintain that uniqueness, let's implement a system for generating and storing those keys.\r\nREASONING:  In order to properly maintain the state of the system and provide unique GPT agent identifiers, we need to develop a system to generate and store GPT agent keys.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Implement a `generate_key` function that creates a new, unique key for a GPT agent and returns it.\r\n-  Add a `register_agent` function to `AutoGPT` that handles the creation and registration of new GPT agents using unique keys.\r\nCRITICISM:  Make sure to properly handle potential key collisions to ensure that keys are always unique.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI.

We can then import this function in other Python files as necessary, which will minimize the amount of duplicated code within the project.\r\nREASONING:  A modular approach to development is important because it makes the code easier to manage and update over time, as well as minimizing the amount of duplicated code. Creating a reusable function that can be imported into other modules makes it easier to maintain the code and enforce consistency across the project.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Create a new Python file to contain the reusable function.\r\n-  Define the function with clear input and output parameters, as well as proper documentation.\r\n-  Save the file and import the function as necessary.\r\nCRITICISM:  Make sure to properly define the input and output parameters of the function, and provide sufficient documentation so that the function can be easily understood and used by others.

A good way to do this is through the use of unit tests. By writing unit tests, we can ensure that our function works as expected and that any future modifications to the function don't break its existing functionality.\r\nREASONING:  Unit tests can help catch issues and bugs in code before they become major problems. By testing a function's functionality, input validation, and expected outputs, we can help ensure that the function works correctly under various conditions. Additionally, tests help us ensure that modifications to the function don't break its pre-existing functionality.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Create a new Python file to contain the unit test for the reusable function.\r\n-  Create test cases for the function using a testing framework such as pytest.\r\n-  Run the tests to check if the function works as expected.\r\nCRITICISM:  When writing unit tests, be sure to cover all possible edge cases of the function, as well as its most common use-cases.

This mechanism can help us identify patterns, recognize potential issues before they become major problems and adapt our development process accordingly.\r\nREASONING:  Analyzing the log file can provide us with valuable data regarding the performance of our development process. By incorporating a monitoring and feedback mechanism, we can regularly review this data and adapt our approach to improve our efficiency, minimize errors and speed up our development time.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Create a new script that reads and analyzes the log file.\r\n-  Identify relevant metrics to track, such as turnaround time or error frequency.\r\n-  Set up the script to generate periodic reports or alerts based on these metrics.\r\nCRITICISM:  To maximize the effectiveness of the monitoring and feedback mechanism, we should be careful to track only the most relevant and useful metrics.

Shall I create a new script that analyzes the log file and generates periodic reports or alerts based on relevant metrics?'}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command message_agent returned: Yes, that sounds like a useful script to have! Depending on the specifics of your log file, there are several tools and libraries that can help with analyzing and processing the data. For example, you could use Python's built-in `datetime` module to parse the timestamps in the log file, and then use a library like Pandas to perform calculations and generate reports based on the data. Alternatively, you could use a dedicated log analysis tool like Splunk or ELK stack to handle the processing and reporting automatically. When designing your script, it's important to define the key metrics and alarm thresholds you want to monitor, and then write the script to generate alerts when those thresholds are exceeded.\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  To implement the log analysis script, we'll need to begin by creating a structured plan and determining the specific metrics we want to measure. We may also need to do some preliminary analysis of the log file to ensure that it contains the necessary data and is properly formatted.\r\nREASONING:  By taking a structured approach to the log analysis script, we can help ensure that it is thorough, efficient, and effective. We need to identify the specific goals of the script and choose the most appropriate tools and methods for achieving them.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Define the key goals and purposes of the log analysis script.\r\n-  Look for any patterns or correlations in the data that suggest important metrics to track.\r\n-  Choose the most appropriate tools and libraries for analyzing and processing the log data.\r\n-  Write the log analysis script with clear methods for measuring and reporting on the selected metrics.\r\nCRITICISM:  It's important to ensure that the log analysis script is flexible enough to accommodate and adapt to changes in the log data over time. We should also be careful not to overcomplicate the script, as it may become difficult to maintain and may generate too much irrelevant data. We should also keep in mind privacy and security issues when accessing and analyzing log data.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = message_agent ARGUMENTS = {'key': 0, 'message': 'To create the log analysis script, we must first define the main objectives of the script and the specific metrics it needs to track.

What are the main objectives of the log analysis script you want to create?\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  The main objectives of the log analysis script are to improve the development process by identifying patterns, issues, and opportunities for improvement based on the data in the log file. The script should also provide alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded, such as the occurrence of critical errors or significant slowdowns in system performance.\r\nREASONING:  By focusing on these main objectives, we can help to optimize the development process and identify opportunities for improvement. We need to choose appropriate metrics for tracking and analyze the data in a way that is actionable and informative.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Identify the key metrics to track based on the project goals and user requirements.\r\n-  Choose a format and structure for the log file that is easily processed and analyzed.\r\n-  Develop methods for analyzing and reporting on the selected metrics.\r\n-  Test and validate the log analysis script and adjust as necessary.\r\nCRITICISM:  The log analysis script should be flexible and robust enough to accommodate different types of log files and development environments.

Would you like to proceed with identifying the key metrics to track?'}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command message_agent returned: Sure, let's identify some key metrics to track that could be useful for meeting those objectives. Here are a few ideas to get started: 1. Total number of log entries per day/week/month: This will give you an overview of the quantity of activity in the system over time. 2. Error rate: The number of log entries that indicate errors or exceptions per day/week/month. This will help you identify patterns in error occurrence and prioritize efforts to fix the most commonly-occurring errors. 3. Response time: The time it takes for the system to respond to requests or complete tasks, measured in milliseconds or seconds. 4. User actions: The type and frequency of actions taken by users in the system. This can include things like login attempts, page views, form submissions, and button clicks. 5. System resource usage: Metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage can indicate the health and efficiency of the system. 6. Number of requests: The total number of requests handled by the system per day/week/month. This will give you an idea of the overall load on the system. Do any of these metrics seem particularly relevant or interesting to you?\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Based on these initial metrics, it might be useful to choose a few key metrics to track in more detail. For example, you might focus on reducing the error rate by identifying the most common types of errors and developing strategies to address them. You could also set a target response time and track progress towards that goal over time. Another option would be to monitor resource usage and optimize the system accordingly. There are many different options depending on your specific goals and priorities.\r\nREASONING:  By starting with a set of initial metrics and then narrowing down to a few key metrics, we can focus our efforts on the most impactful areas and measure progress in a more targeted way. This will help us to make data-driven decisions and continuously improve the development process.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Review the initial metrics suggested and identify any that are particularly relevant to the project goals.\r\n-  Choose a few key metrics to track in more detail and define specific targets or thresholds.\r\n-  Develop methods for tracking and analyzing these metrics over time.\r\n-  Use the data to make informed decisions and continuously improve the development process.\r\nCRITICISM:  It is important to select metrics that are relevant and actionable, rather than simply tracking everything without a clear plan or purpose. The metrics should also be flexible enough to adapt to changing circumstances and evolving project goals.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = message_agent ARGUMENTS = {'key': 0, 'message': 'Based on these initial metrics, it might be useful to choose a few key metrics to track in more detail. For examples, you might focus on reducing the error rate, setting a target response time, or monitoring resource usage. Would you like more time to consider these options or is there something specific you would like to focus on?'}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command message_agent returned: Reducing the error rate is a good objective to start with, so let's focus on that for now. To track the error rate, we could count the number of error entries per day or per week and create an alert when a certain threshold of errors is exceeded. For instance, we could generate an alert whenever the number of errors is greater than a certain percentage of the total log entries for a given period. We could also analyze the type of errors that are occurring and the frequency of their occurrence. This information can provide insights into the most common causes of errors, which in turn would enable us to prioritize our efforts to fix the most critical errors impacting the system. Does this approach sound reasonable?\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Yes, that sounds like a reasonable approach. To implement this, we will need to develop a logging and alerting system that is flexible enough to track and analyze different types of errors, while also being structured enough to enable actionable insights. We can begin by defining the metrics we will track, developing a schema for logging errors, and creating a system for generating alerts when a certain threshold is reached. We can then analyze the data over time and use the insights to continuously improve our development process.\r\nREASONING:  By establishing a logging and alerting system, we can ensure that we are tracking critical errors in a systematic way, and that we are generating insights that can help us to improve our processes over time. This approach will help us to make data-driven decisions and continuously improve the development process.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Define the metrics we will track and establish a schema for logging errors.\r\n-  Develop a system for generating alerts when a certain threshold is reached.\r\n-  Use the data to identify patterns and insights about the error rate, types of errors, and root causes.\r\n-  Use the insights to make informed decisions and continuously improve the development process.\r\nCRITICISM:  It is important to ensure that the logging and alerting system is structured in a way that enables actionable insights, rather than simply generating data without a clear purpose. It is also important to establish clear thresholds and targets for the metrics we will track, in order to ensure that we are measuring progress in a meaningful way.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = message_agent ARGUMENTS = {'key': 0, 'message': 'To implement our approach to tracking errors, we will need to develop a logging and alerting system that is flexible enough to track and analyze different types of errors, while also being structured enough to enable actionable insights. Are there any specific requirements or concerns you would like to address at this time?'}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command message_agent returned: Yes, there are several considerations to keep in mind when designing a logging and alerting system for tracking errors: 1. Logging granularity: The logging system should be fine-grained enough to capture as much detail as possible about the errors, while also minimizing the impact on system performance. We should aim to log enough information to enable debugging and root cause analysis, without overwhelming the system with log entries. 2. Error categorization: It's important to develop a system for categorizing different types of errors based on severity and impact on the system. This will enable us to prioritize our efforts to fix the most critical errors first. 3. Alert triggers: We need to define precise triggers for generating alerts based on the frequency and severity of errors. We could set thresholds based on the total number of errors per time period, the percentage of errors compared to total log entries, or other factors. 4. Alert channels: We should also define the channels and recipients of the alerts, such as email, push notifications, or SMS messages. It may be useful to route alerts to different recipients based on the severity and type of error. 5. Historical analysis: We should enable the ability to analyze the historical trends in error rates and other metrics over time. This will help us identify patterns and underlying causes of errors that may not be immediately discernible from individual log entries. Does this sound like a reasonable set of requirements for our logging and alerting system?\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  We should now create a function in Python that generates a random password of a specified length. We can use the random and string libraries to generate a random combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. This function could be useful for automated account creation or password resets where a strong, random password is required.\r\nREASONING:  Generating strong and random passwords is an important part of security when it comes to account creation and user authentication. By having a function that generates a random password of a specified length, we can ensure that the password is not easily guessed or brute-forced, and that it conforms to password complexity rules.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Create a new Python file within the 'project_files' directory to store the new password generation function.\\\\\\\\n- Define a function that takes in a parameter for password length and returns a random password of the specified length.\\\\\\\\n- Use the random and string libraries to generate a random selection of characters for the password.\\\\\\\\n- Test the function by calling it with various input lengths to verify that it returns the expected output.\\\\\\\\n- Add the password generation function to our task log and commit the changes to source control.\r\nCRITICISM:  When generating random passwords, it's important to ensure that the passwords are not easily guessable or based on a predictable pattern. Additionally, we should consider any specific password complexity requirements and ensure that the generated password meets those requirements. We should also store the generated password securely and avoid transmitting it in plaintext whenever possible.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = message_agent ARGUMENTS = {'key': 0, 'message': \"I would like to create a new Python file within the 'project_files' directory to store a password generation function we could use for account creation and password resets. Shall I proceed?\"}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command message_agent returned: Yes, that sounds like a good idea! You can create a new Python file in the 'project_files' directory with a suitable name, such as \"password_generator.py\". Once you have created the file, you can start writing your password generation function. Do you have any specific requirements for the password generation function? For example, do you need to set specific password length or character combinations?\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Thank you for the suggestion. Since you did not specify any password requirements, I will create a password generator function that generates random passwords of a specified length, using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. I will name the file 'password_generator.py' within the 'project_files' directory. Here are the steps to create the file and write the function.\r\nREASONING:  By creating a new file to store the password generator function, we can ensure that the function is self-contained and can be easily reused in other parts of the codebase. Generating a mix of characters will provide more complexity and security to the passwords.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Open your preferred Python IDE or text editor.\\\\\\\\n- Create a new file named 'password_generator.py' within the 'project_files' directory.\\\\\\\\n- Import the 'random' and 'string' libraries.\\\\\\\\n- Define a function named 'generate_password' that takes a single argument - the length of the password. \\\\\\\\n- Use the 'string.ascii_letters', 'string.digits', and 'string.punctuation' constants to create a string of all uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.\\\\\\\\n- Call random.choice() method to randomly select characters from the generated string until the desired password length is reached. \\\\\\\\n- Close the text editor or IDE.\r\nCRITICISM:  When generating passwords, it's important to carefully consider the type and length of the password to ensure that it meets any complexity requirements. Additionally, we should store passwords securely for our users, and avoid sending passwords in plaintext over unencrypted connections.\r\nAttempting to fix JSON by finding outermost brackets\r\nApparently json was fixed.\r\nNEXT ACTION:  COMMAND = do_nothing ARGUMENTS = {}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command do_nothing returned: Unknown command 'do_nothing'. Please refer to the 'COMMANDS' list for available commands and only respond in the specified JSON format.\r\nAI_GPT_8 THOUGHTS:  Let's create a function called 'parse_arguments' that will parse arguments from a JSON string and return a dictionary mapping argument names to their values. We can use the built-in 'json' library in Python to parse the JSON string. In order to make the function more robust, we should also add error-checking mechanisms to detect when the argument names or values are missing or invalid.\r\nREASONING:  Creating a 'parse_arguments' function will help us handle arguments passed to our functions and commands in a consistent and organized way. It will also make it easier to modify or add new arguments in the future. Error-checking mechanisms will ensure that we don't run into issues when missing or invalid arguments are passed to our functions.\r\nPLAN:\r\n-  Define the 'parse_arguments' function in a new Python module.\r\n-  Add error-checking mechanisms to the function to detect missing or invalid arguments.\r\n-  Test the function with sample JSON strings to verify that it correctly extracts the arguments.\r\nCRITICISM:  Be careful when defining the JSON format for arguments in each command.

We'll implement error-checking mechanisms to make the function more robust. Shall we proceed?\"}\r\nSYSTEM:  Command message_agent returned: Sure, we can create a function called `parse_arguments` as per your requirements. Here's a possible implementation in Python: ```python import json def parse_arguments(args_json): try: args_dict = json.loads(args_json) except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError): return None # Return `None` if the input is not valid JSON. if not isinstance(args_dict, dict): return None # Return `None` if the JSON object is not a dictionary. return args_dict ``` The `parse_arguments` function first attempts to decode the input JSON string using the `json.loads` method. If this raises a `JSONDecodeError` exception, or if the input is not a string, the function returns `None` to indicate that the input is invalid. Next, the function checks whether the decoded JSON object is a dictionary using the `isinstance` function. If the JSON object is not a dictionary, the function returns `None`. Finally, if the JSON object is a dictionary, the function simply returns this dictionary as output. This implementation should provide a robust way to parse arguments from a JSON string, and can be extended with additional error-checking or input validation as needed.\r\n  Warning: Failed to parse AI output, attempting to fix.\r\n If you see this warning frequently, it's likely that your prompt is confusing the AI.

If the string is shorter than `max_length`, return the original string. You can use Python string slicing to implement this function.\r\n2. Write unit tests for the `truncate_string` function in \"test_utils.py\". Ensure that the tests cover edge cases such as empty strings and strings that are already shorter than `max_length`.\r\n3. Create a new Python file called \"file_utils.py\".\r\n4. Implement a function in \"file_utils.py\" called `read_json_file` that accepts a filename and returns a dictionary of objects read from the file. The function should read the specified file in JSON format using `json.load` and return the resulting dictionary. If the file cannot be read or decoded, `read_json_file` should return an empty dictionary.\r\n5. Write unit tests for the `read_json_file` function in a new file called \"test_file_utils.py\". Ensure that the tests cover all relevant use cases and edge cases.\r\n6. In \"utils.py\", create a function called `get_current_time_string` that returns the current time as a string in the format \"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\".\r\n7. Implement a new function in \"file_utils.py\" called `write_log_entry_to_file` that accepts a message string and a filename, and writes a log entry using the current timestamp as well as the input message string to the specified file. The log entry should be in the following format: `\"[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] message string\\n\"`. Use the `with open as file:` method to file directly and handle file opening and closing automatically.\r\n8. Write unit tests for the `write_log_entry_to_file` function in \"test_file_utils.py\".

Ensure that the tests cover all relevant use cases and edge cases.\r\n3. In \"file_utils.py\", add a new function called `append_to_csv_file` that takes a file name and a list of tuples as arguments. Each tuple should contain values to be written to one row of the CSV file. If the file already exists, append the rows from the list to the end of the file. If it does not exist, create it and write the rows to the file.\r\n4. Write unit tests for the `append_to_csv_file` function in \"test_file_utils.py\". Add tests that cover the creation of new files, appending to existing files, and edge cases such as empty lists.\r\n5. In \"utils.py\", implement a function called `pretty_print_dict` that takes in a single dictionary as an argument and returns a nicely formatted string representation of the dictionary, with one key-value pair per line. You can use Python string manipulation to achieve this.\r\n6. Write unit tests for the `pretty_print_dict` function in \"test_utils.py\". Ensure that the tests cover edge cases such as empty dictionaries and dictionaries with different types of values.\r\n7. **Output the results to the file** \"result.txt\" in a new folder named \"output\" using the `write_to_file` command.

This will allow Auto-GPT to gradually build up the\r\n  system while minimizing the impact of errors or setbacks. Track time and based on\r\n  that tracking make lasting improvements in time effitiency in the longrun.\r\n- Break down and improve components of the development process into small, manageable\r\n  tasks. Improve text file records or logs or machanism/s. Use systems that that you\r\n  (Auto-GPT) can follow. And that let you progress on previous programs and files you made.\r\n  Improve the foundations of files and folders you make to increase the maximum speed you\r\n  can make towards the main goal. Somehow use your strenghts and capabilitys to build upon\r\n  previous progress since it is a for now 2-3 week deadline long project that might be extended\r\n  somehow make maximum progress maybe you need to build things that allow you to make faster\r\n  progress or be able to build upon previous work at all. Your language models using databases\r\n  and files to recall and plan might lose partially all cached memory and somehow you need to \r\n  figure out the best way to archive your goal anyway or build so much that it makes sense to\r\n  extend your time since the progress will be faster and faster and you just initially made\r\n  made preparations to later be faster.\r\n- Improve the development process by analyzing records/logs.\r\n  If a task is not completed within a specified time frame, Auto-GPT should move on\r\n  to the next task, and note the issue in the log file for later review. Periodically\r\n  review & apply from this path C:\\Programming\\Auto-GPT_AI_8\\auto_gpt_workspace\\User_input\r\n  the least tryed ideas/suggestions, especially those inside the folder \"Priority\". Make\r\n  sure you react and take into account the one Users feedback. Improving seamless continuation\r\n  of previous progress between shutdowns is a priority since continuing and building itteratively\r\n  seems to be the biggest challenge between errors, and forgetting and being sidetracked by\r\n  things not working. Make improvements that conect into each other and you can always find\r\n  and continue again even when losing most memory. Improve that transition between restarts every\r\n  10-60 minutes!\r\n- Improve checkpoint mechanism/s that periodically save/s compelted milestones, relevant\r\n  data as text files. Implement a monitoring and feedback mechanism that analyzes\r\n  existing files. Use this analysis to find patterns/issues/etc that cause setbacks\r\n  or failures, and adapt the development process accordingly to improve efficiency,\r\n  error-resistance and seamless continuation of previous progress between shutdowns that\r\n  happen(every 5-25 minutes with maybe a maximum of 1 hour of continus work without criticall\r\n  erros wiping your memory. Its like you are constantly starting and working with multible different\r\n  chats. Noone knows everything but you somehow have to work together and figure it out.\r\n- Track and iteratively make small improvements to the modular development approach.\r\n  Prioritice reusable self-contained components and tasks that serve as the foundation\r\n  for more complex functionalities. If non exists make a team of 3 agents that are\r\n  tasked with tyding up and mindfully reducing chaos and Red tape. Sort by puting\r\n  files into folders with structured categories. Be orderly, no identical names\r\n  and try to keep files per folder under 40.\r\nai_name: AI_GPT_8\r\nai_role: Auto-GPT is software designed to iteratively and autonomously develop a new\r\n  languagemodel-based system on the User/s PC should do meta-learning with the help of\r\n  neural networks, machine learning etc. Auto-GPT should leverage existing e.g. python\r\n  resources, imports, and online content to enhance an existing free language model. The\r\n  goal is to enable Auto-GPT to create a self-improving system that becomes more efficient\r\n  and effective over time, despite Auto-GPT/s own memory retrival/loss problems and other\r\n  challenges. For selfawareness it likely helps Auto-GPT to analyze its source code\r\n  files at C:\\Programming\\Auto-GPT_AI_8 or other reserach e.g. online. Suggestions Create\r\n  python files for individual actions. Then in a modular fassion string them together in new\r\n  python files as a foundation for more complex chains of actions without having to individually\r\n  run them. Save them with different names, and maybe a number, according to the task they serve.\r\n  You can then reuse them whenever needed. Make sure you remember them to effectively use them\r\n  and so you dont duplicate files for no reason. Begin with simple actions files that provide\r\n  the foundation for more compex actionchains by calling multible of them in new python files.\r\n  That way you increase timeeffitiency and effitiency. To send message to user make folder\r\n  called \"message_to_user\" and write to textfile by \"Output the results to a file\" inside, after\r\n  that the User will respond by putting his response in a txtfile inside of \"answer_from_user\" folder.\r\n```\r\n", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1085/reactions", "total_count": 1, "+1": 1, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1085/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1080", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1080/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1080/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1080/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/1080", "id": 1666064416, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5jTiAg", "number": 1080, "title": "Autoupdater: Auto `git pull` at startup", "user": {"login": "Artemonim", "id": 36363466, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM2MzYzNDY2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36363466?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim", "html_url": "https://github.com/Artemonim", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Artemonim/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5272676243, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABOkankw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 6, "created_at": "2023-04-13T09:32:38Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-20T09:15:55Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "CONTRIBUTOR", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\r\n\r\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\r\n\r\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\r\n\r\nWe need a script, which will check the updates, do `git pull` and restart the run\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\n1. `git status`\r\n2.

Background\r\n\r\nThe LocalCache memory backend implemented in https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/pull/372 used a handrolled implementation of a storage engine, and the embedding strategy was pinned to `text-embedding-ada-002` which we may want to change/does cost money/latency\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n- reimplemented LocalCache using [Chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) - which also runs either in-memory or persisted, but is well tested and managed. \r\n- made embeddings swappable to ANY openai embedding model - and uses the Chroma default [SentenceTransformers](https://docs.trychroma.com/embeddings#default-sentence-transformers) which costs no money \r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n[in

Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\nGeneral discussion among the AI community has been lately expressing concern about alignment, risk and recklessness in recent developments. This intends to alleviate concerns, allowing users to put more trust leaving in AutoGPT on its own.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\nThis PR adds a Risk Avoidance (Hybrid) mode, mutually exclusive with Continuous mode and meant to be a midpoint between full-auto and human assisted. When under this mode, an intermediate GPT call will be made to evaluate every command executed. If the calculated risk exceeds a user-defined threshold, execution is paused until the human manually approves it. There are relevant additions made to configuration, both in environment variables (threshold and model to use) and the command-line argument to activate the mode.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\nChanges are documented with code comments. I believe them to be sufficient, plus the added behavior is pretty self-descriptive.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\nI tested the risk avoidance mode by running AutoGPT with the --riskAvoidance flag and several risk thresholds to calibrate its correct behavior. The prompt used to assess risk was thoroughly tested with both gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 through the ChatGPT interface, with what I consider to be success.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thoroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as separate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

Look for my \"batches\" for inspiration. This is an example:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are duplicates, choose one primary issue and put the duplicate issues along the PRs in the second-level lists. We can tell PRs from issues by the icons.\r\n\r\nNote that you must be able to tell a defect from non-defect (in a necessarily subjective way). For example:\r\n\r\n- Something that is caused by flaky GPT response (e.g. not answering in JSON, not giving proper instructions to agents and so on) is a prompt engineering defect. Those should not be considered genuine defect for the purpose of this issue, as they are hard to fix and require benchmarking that we don't currently have handy\r\n- Something that adds a new thing is not a defect. E.g. we had logging. If the logging is not broken and works as it's planned during its creation, then it's not a defect\r\n- Something that causes a stack trace is always a defect. Ideally, we should only have error messages, and the traces will be shown only in the debug mode. This will greatly improve the UX for the non-technical users, while imposing a moderate reproduction hassle on developers. With Auto-GPT being a pop star this is essential. I'm not a Pythoner so I ask if this is implementable at all (e.g. in JS you can display the error stack trace in the catch handler at will)\r\n- Something that makes AutoGPT unusable for a layperson is a defect as long as it doesn't require a major overhaul (e.g. Ctrl-C displaying a stacktrace would be considered as a defect)\r\n\r\nThis doesn't require an approval to anyone, and it shouldn't be intrusive. Try doing a small list and if people don't start screaming on you go on. Work with complaints on your own too, when people say that this is defect and this is not (they certainly will, it's what people do). This is the right way to silently contribute, as the main team don't have time to review and approve all the activities.\r\n\n\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\n\nHi all,\r\n\r\nThis is the current list of defects as defined by @nponeccop in #...\r\n\r\n- #803 \r\n  - #804 \r\n  - #696 \r\n\n\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\n\nWith the now infamous `debug_mode` breakage, we need to figure out the current list of defects, and merge fixes for defects first. So, it's important to classify the current issues and figure out the list of the priority PRs to merge before the \"batches\" process.\r\n\r\nNote that the batches process is prioritized by the PR number, so once your PR is valid (e.g. reviewed to be clean and mergeable), and got into a batch, and is not a big feature, you can be sure that it will be merged in this batch as long as you fix the conflicts. This is IMO an important motivation for the PR authors, that we essentially will merge all old small good PRs in the FIFO order.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/926/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/926/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/916", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/916/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/916/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/916/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/916", "id": 1663924513, "node_id": "PR_kwDOJKSTjM5OGcjA", "number": 916, "title": "Model temperature and token limit can now be set through the AI setup wizard", "user": {"login": "GulkoA", "id": 42573629, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjQyNTczNjI5", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42573629?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA", "html_url": "https://github.com/GulkoA", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/GulkoA/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5272676243, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABOkankw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}, {"id": 5400185961, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABQeBMaQ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/conflicts", "name": "conflicts", "color": "FBCA04", "default": false, "description": "Automatically applied to PRs with merge conflicts"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 5, "created_at": "2023-04-12T06:32:32Z", "updated_at": "2023-04-22T23:26:09Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "draft": false, "pull_request": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pulls/916", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/916", "diff_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/916.diff", "patch_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/pull/916.patch", "merged_at": null}, "body": "<!-- \ud83d\udce2 Announcement\r\nWe've recently noticed an increase in pull requests focusing on combining multiple changes.

This PR adds those settings into the setup wizard at the start of the script. Users may still elect to keep the defaults.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n`ai_config.py` has 2 new parameters: `ai_temperature` and `ai_token_limit`. The file is updated to save/load them to/from the file and sets defaults if the constructor does not receive them. Defaults for them are stored in an instance dictionary in AIConfig class and can be easily adjusted if necessary.\r\nThe setup wizard in `main.py` is modified to allow those parameters to be set by the user. `construct_prompt()` is renamed to `load_model_config()` and is modified to return the AIConfig object. Prompt construction is moved to the main body. \r\n`chat_with_ai` in `chat.py` is modified to receive `AIConfig` as a parameter instead of `token_limit`. This allows passing temperature and token limit to be passed together. The body is modified accordingly to use those values.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nAll method documentation comments were adjusted to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe functionality of the AutoGPT was not modified, so the tests only included the setup process with different inputs.

All changes are modular, and the existing code has been minimally altered to adhere to the Separation of Concerns principle.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nTests cover the initialization of a Summary instance, incrementation of the step counter, printing of step and final summaries to the console, appending of step summaries and results to the summary file, formatting of the final summary prompt, and extraction of the step summary from the assistant's reply. \r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [?] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change \r\nIt's not really a single change, but it's a very modular change.

functionality is not \"crystal clear\" insomuch that while I have the impression that it can be used to retain knowledge acquired between Auto-GPT program/script executions in order to establish some level of associative cross pollination between sessions, but whether or not it actually does and/or uses this is not clear.\r\n\r\nCould we have some additional information and clarity on this topic?\r\n\r\nAlso, if it does utilize and work together with this, could we, instead of having a .env configuration variable, have in its place a command line argument or simply use the session name as a key generator to retain associativity? \r\n\r\nFor example, if want to retain memory associations, maybe a convention such as this could be done: For the name, if we have \"Entrepreneur-GPT\" then any future names, even with different roles and goals but with the same \"Entrepreneur-GPT\" name could have a memory index keyed to that name numerically through a simple algorithm that will use that to associatively operate.

This AGI might be one single Auto-GPT that loops against itself, but I doubt it because the LLM is super slow. We can't expect to have something that has high computing power with only one autonomous agent. And we can't have one agent per computing machine, that's stupid, because most of the time the running process will just hang and do nothing, waiting for Open AI to give back an answer. Waste of resources. Running multiple agents in different tabs is not ideal either because processes are heavier than threads.\r\nOn the current PR I was able to spawn 20 concurrent workers simultaneously without any problem.\r\n\r\nSo I think that in order to build an AGI, we need to build an entity able to:\r\n- Define autonomous agents.\r\n- Start autonomous agents\r\n- Monitor autonomous agents. This means being able to identify all the meaningful events happening to them and talk to them. (this is not part of this PR unfortunately, it's too many changes at once, but I have a branch ready for it) => \r\n- Stop these workers when necessary.\r\n\r\nWhich programmatic language is the AGI going to use to do that? A proper, well-defined REST API is the way to go, we can only do so much with a CLI.\r\n\r\nThis AGI will talk to its workers through rest api calls, which are nothing more than JSON sent over the network.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning we will be playing the AGI, so we will use these endpoints to communicate with our agents, through a web browser UI.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nNow let's come back to reality, I had to work with what the repo provides, so I made the smallest changes possible to achieve these goals. **The first thing I want to say, is that my changes won't affect the users in any way. All the existing features are preserved and unchanged.**\r\n\r\nAdditions to the repo **that are all necessary to achieve this User Story** (I insist they're all necessary to be merged together):\r\n- A well-structured web server with FastAPI.\r\n- Solid integration tests, extremely readable because all the expected requests and responses are written. These integration tests record the behavior of the autonomous agents. I will use these tests to maintain an automatically generated documentation of auto-gpt api. \r\n- The integration tests work with GPT3.5 and the cost is very small. Talking about cost, @Torantulino please create an online bank account for auto-gpt organization so we can wire money and pay for an api key that will use to call open AI within github action. You can keep the key private. I will wire 100$ to the bank account when you have it ready. Also, I know some companies interested sponsoring auto-gpt, so reach out to me on discord.\r\n- Ability to stop an autonomous agent gracefully, without forcing it. Each agent runs in separates threads.\r\n- a NoMemory class. Why is that ? Because right now memories are shared accross the same worker !!! So it means if we spawn multiple autonomous agents, they will step into each other's toes. The great news is that NoMemory is actually super performant, I have tested it and it performs oftentimes better than pinecone, mostly because we load an ugly JSON of all the past memories and it confuses the AI. Particularly with GPT 3.5. It turns out summarizing the content as we go and loosing any non essential information can be great for short tasks.\r\n- the server is currently in a folder called app with the right project structure for a project of this size. This was the easiest way to do it without breaking the whole repo. This repo has no module, and I can't put the api under a folder called \"scripts\", that's beyond me :)\r\n\r\nCHANGES to the repo:\r\n- finally wrap the main.py into an \"if ___main___\", otherwise nothing in this project is reusable, right now I can't import the main.py without starting the loop haha\r\n- create the autonomous agent class so that it can start the start_loop method\r\n- create attributes of the class. It's pretty much adding self everywhere.\r\n- The temperature is currently None in the repo which means 1. The values are between 0 and 2. For my tests I need a very consistent LLM, so I need 0. So I just put an environment variable. The value will still be 1 for others and nothing changes. (I recommend putting the default value to 0 by the way this is a game changer, but that's another story...)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nLook at the tests, they document clearly the following requests and responses as well as the output of the worker:\r\n2 integration tests at the moment: \r\n- Autonomous agent defined (POST), started (PATCH) STOPPED immediately after starting (PATCH)\r\n- Autonomous agent defined (POST), started (PATCH), Writes a file and shuts down on its own. When we try to shut it down we get a 500 because it's already down.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049456-95d0950e-8996-4766-a61a-1fe0f5cb9999.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049458-55217c4c-ead9-4e15-a5fb-89a83cb428f5.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 24 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049459-ba1fc769-2b78-49e9-99e6-1bcf25dba8c4.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049461-ca10c4ff-95a2-41d8-9cd6-223b26c94e33.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe CLI has to keep working !!!

If the file gets beyond a few paragraphs this starts to cause issues often time causing json parsing error. Could we somehow have it insert text into an existing file. Maybe we can have it give vim commands to edit it.\r\n\r\nBeen running a benchmark of having it write a fluid simulation using the lattice boltzmann method. Been running this everyday for a week or so to see the progress of Auto-GPT developments.

See https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/25#issuecomment-1499531177\r\n\r\nLocal models and embeddings offer better privacy, lower costs, and enable new uses, like Auto-GPT experiments in private/air-gapped networks. To get these benefits, we should add local (offline) embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nA version of ooba's text-generation-webui, called [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory), has done this using zarr and Numpy.

We mention it only as a reference. We need to create a similar setup in Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\n### Motivation \ud83d\udd26\r\n\r\n1. Better Privacy: Local embeddings keep user data on their devices or networks, avoiding the risk of online data breaches.\r\n2. Lower Costs: Users save money on cloud storage, bandwidth, and processing power when they use local embeddings.\r\n3. Offline Use: Auto-GPT can work in offline environments or areas with limited internet, like secure facilities or remote research stations.\r\n4. Customization: Users can create and manage their own embeddings for better model performance and results.\r\n5. Faster Response: Local embeddings can speed up response times since data doesn't need to travel to remote servers.\r\n\r\nBy adding local embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT, users get more control, flexibility, and benefits like privacy, cost savings, and accessibility.", "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/347/reactions", "total_count": 7, "+1": 7, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/347/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/346", "repository_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/346/labels{/name}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/346/comments", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/346/events", "html_url": "https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/issues/346", "id": 1657996126, "node_id": "I_kwDOJKSTjM5i0wNe", "number": 346, "title": "How about let AutoGPT to access a virtual machine like VirtualBox, use mouse and keyboard, and surf like a human.", "user": {"login": "artheru", "id": 6483114, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjY0ODMxMTQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6483114?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru", "html_url": "https://github.com/artheru", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/artheru/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "labels": [{"id": 5272676243, "node_id": "LA_kwDOJKSTjM8AAAABOkankw", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT/labels/enhancement", "name": "enhancement", "color": "a2eeef", "default": true, "description": "New feature or request"}], "state": "open", "locked": false, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "milestone": null, "comments": 14, "created_at": "2023-04-06T20:19:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-05-01T14:32:25Z", "closed_at": null, "author_association": "NONE", "active_lock_reason": null, "body": "### Duplicates\n\n- [X] I have searched the existing issues\n\n### Summary \ud83d\udca1\n\n1.

outputs.\r\n\r\nTesting: Write unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected and to catch any potential issues during development.\r\n\r\nSecurity: Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as code injection.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Use a configuration file or environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys, rather than hardcoding them in

can be increadible\r\nOne important thing to remember, is to check each submit and flag potentially harmful insite reports\r\nThen we need to come up with a rating mechanism, like stars, flags, something like stackoverflow, that agents can mark if some insight was helpful, or not helpful, etc, and this database of solutions/insights will be a fluid and evolving knowledge base\r\nmight even be wise to allocate \"repositories\" or \"namespaces\" that can be verified by the comunity, the repo can be a client to a public pinecone server, that is managed and verified by the comunity and only accepts verified insight submissions\r\n\r\nLike a good fleet, we need to share with eachother all the safe and useful progress, and flag bad practices\r\n\r\nIf you get my drift, please tag relevant

This feature combines the benefits of Continuous Mode with the human-in-the-loop experience of Active Mode.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two modes available:\r\n\r\n1. \"[Continuous Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/#-continuous-mode-%EF%B8%8F),\" which allows the AI to run without user authorization and is 100% automated. However, this mode is not recommended due to its potential dangers, such as running indefinitely or performing actions that users might not approve.\r\n2. \"[Active Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/13),\" which enables the AI to run while actively prompting the user with chain-of-thought questions when executing each subsequent action. This allows users to actively participate while the AI agent runs, ensuring a human-in-the-loop experience.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance user engagement and provide a more flexible experience, I propose a new feature called \"Semi-Active Mode.\"\r\n\r\n## Feature Description\r\n\r\nIn \"Semi-Active Mode,\" the AI will:\r\n\r\n1. Execute an action.\r\n2. Evaluate its confidence in the action or result.\r\n3. If the confidence is below a certain threshold, prompt the user for assistance or clarification.\r\n4. Incorporate the user's input and continue to the next action.\r\n\r\nThis interaction pattern allows users to assist when needed while still benefiting from the AI's capabilities. It strikes a balance between full automation and active participation, fostering a collaborative environment between the user and the AI system.\r\n\r\n## Example Implementation\r\n\r\nHere's an example implementation using LangChain's [Human-As-A-Tool](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/human_tools.html) feature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent\r\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType\r\n\r\nllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)\r\nmath_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)\r\ntools = load_tools(\r\n    [\"human\", \"llm-math\"], \r\n    llm=math_llm,\r\n)\r\n\r\nagent_chain = initialize_agent(\r\n    tools,\r\n    llm,\r\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\nagent_chain.run(\"What is Eric Zhu's birthday?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, the AI agent seeks human assistance when it encounters uncertainty, allowing the user to guide as needed.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n-  Enhanced user engagement\r\n-  Reduced risk of AI performing unwanted actions\r\n-  Increased collaboration between the user and the AI\r\n-  Balances automation and user control\r\n\r\n## Risks and Mitigations\r\n\r\nThis feature may slow down the overall AI operation due to the need for user input in certain situations. However, this trade-off is acceptable, considering the increased control and collaboration it provides.\r\n\r\n## Request for Comments\r\n\r\nI would appreciate feedback from the community on this suggested feature.
