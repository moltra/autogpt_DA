Include relevant context, prior discussions, or links to related issues. Ensure that the change aligns with the project's overall direction. -->\r\n\r\nA user can communicate with Auto-GPT in a language other than English that does not contain the letters y, n. In this case, the user have to change the keyboard layout between simple and text response to English and back. The numbers are (most likely) the same in any layout.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n<!-- Describe the specific, focused change made in this pull request. Detail the modifications clearly and avoid any unrelated or \"extra\" changes. -->\r\n\r\nThe addition of 1/0 has been added as alternatives to y/n in the main.py script to allow non-English speaking users to communicate with Auto-GPT more easily.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n<!-- Explain how your changes are documented, such as in-code comments or external documentation. Ensure that the documentation is clear, concise, and easy to understand. -->\r\n\r\nIn the main.py script, a comment has been added to explain that 1/0 can be used as an alternative to y/n for non-English speaking users.\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\n<!-- Describe how you tested this functionality. Include steps to reproduce, relevant test cases, and any other pertinent information. -->\r\n\r\nTo test this functionality, I performed the following steps:\r\n- Changed the keyboard layout to a language other than English that does not contain the letters y, n.\r\n- Prompted Auto-GPT for a response that requires a y/n input.\r\n- Verified that entering 1/0 instead of y/n returned the expected response from Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\nAs this is a relatively small and straightforward change, no new test cases were added.\r\n\r\n### PR Quality Checklist\r\n- [x] My pull request is atomic and focuses on a single change.\r\n- [x] I have thouroughly tested my changes with multiple different prompts.\r\n- [x] I have considered potential risks and mitigations for my changes.\r\n- [x] I have documented my changes clearly and comprehensively.\r\n- [x] I have not snuck in any \"extra\" small tweaks changes <!-- Submit these as seperate Pull Reqests, they are the easiest to merge! -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you haven't added tests, please explain why.

This AGI might be one single Auto-GPT that loops against itself, but I doubt it because the LLM is super slow. We can't expect to have something that has high computing power with only one autonomous agent. And we can't have one agent per computing machine, that's stupid, because most of the time the running process will just hang and do nothing, waiting for Open AI to give back an answer. Waste of resources. Running multiple agents in different tabs is not ideal either because processes are heavier than threads.\r\nOn the current PR I was able to spawn 20 concurrent workers simultaneously without any problem.\r\n\r\nSo I think that in order to build an AGI, we need to build an entity able to:\r\n- Define autonomous agents.\r\n- Start autonomous agents\r\n- Monitor autonomous agents. This means being able to identify all the meaningful events happening to them and talk to them. (this is not part of this PR unfortunately, it's too many changes at once, but I have a branch ready for it) => \r\n- Stop these workers when necessary.\r\n\r\nWhich programmatic language is the AGI going to use to do that? A proper, well-defined REST API is the way to go, we can only do so much with a CLI.\r\n\r\nThis AGI will talk to its workers through rest api calls, which are nothing more than JSON sent over the network.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning we will be playing the AGI, so we will use these endpoints to communicate with our agents, through a web browser UI.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\nNow let's come back to reality, I had to work with what the repo provides, so I made the smallest changes possible to achieve these goals. **The first thing I want to say, is that my changes won't affect the users in any way. All the existing features are preserved and unchanged.**\r\n\r\nAdditions to the repo **that are all necessary to achieve this User Story** (I insist they're all necessary to be merged together):\r\n- A well-structured web server with FastAPI.\r\n- Solid integration tests, extremely readable because all the expected requests and responses are written. These integration tests record the behavior of the autonomous agents. I will use these tests to maintain an automatically generated documentation of auto-gpt api. \r\n- The integration tests work with GPT3.5 and the cost is very small. Talking about cost, @Torantulino please create an online bank account for auto-gpt organization so we can wire money and pay for an api key that will use to call open AI within github action. You can keep the key private. I will wire 100$ to the bank account when you have it ready. Also, I know some companies interested sponsoring auto-gpt, so reach out to me on discord.\r\n- Ability to stop an autonomous agent gracefully, without forcing it. Each agent runs in separates threads.\r\n- a NoMemory class. Why is that ? Because right now memories are shared accross the same worker !!! So it means if we spawn multiple autonomous agents, they will step into each other's toes. The great news is that NoMemory is actually super performant, I have tested it and it performs oftentimes better than pinecone, mostly because we load an ugly JSON of all the past memories and it confuses the AI. Particularly with GPT 3.5. It turns out summarizing the content as we go and loosing any non essential information can be great for short tasks.\r\n- the server is currently in a folder called app with the right project structure for a project of this size. This was the easiest way to do it without breaking the whole repo. This repo has no module, and I can't put the api under a folder called \"scripts\", that's beyond me :)\r\n\r\nCHANGES to the repo:\r\n- finally wrap the main.py into an \"if ___main___\", otherwise nothing in this project is reusable, right now I can't import the main.py without starting the loop haha\r\n- create the autonomous agent class so that it can start the start_loop method\r\n- create attributes of the class. It's pretty much adding self everywhere.\r\n- The temperature is currently None in the repo which means 1. The values are between 0 and 2. For my tests I need a very consistent LLM, so I need 0. So I just put an environment variable. The value will still be 1 for others and nothing changes. (I recommend putting the default value to 0 by the way this is a game changer, but that's another story...)\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nLook at the tests, they document clearly the following requests and responses as well as the output of the worker:\r\n2 integration tests at the moment: \r\n- Autonomous agent defined (POST), started (PATCH) STOPPED immediately after starting (PATCH)\r\n- Autonomous agent defined (POST), started (PATCH), Writes a file and shuts down on its own. When we try to shut it down we get a 500 because it's already down.\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 34 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049456-95d0950e-8996-4766-a61a-1fe0f5cb9999.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 29 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049458-55217c4c-ead9-4e15-a5fb-89a83cb428f5.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 24 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049459-ba1fc769-2b78-49e9-99e6-1bcf25dba8c4.png)\r\n![Screenshot 2023-04-10 at 8 32 16 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9652976/231049461-ca10c4ff-95a2-41d8-9cd6-223b26c94e33.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Test Plan\r\nThe CLI has to keep working !!!

See https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/25#issuecomment-1499531177\r\n\r\nLocal models and embeddings offer better privacy, lower costs, and enable new uses, like Auto-GPT experiments in private/air-gapped networks. To get these benefits, we should add local (offline) embeddings storage and recall to Auto-GPT.\r\n\r\n### Examples \ud83c\udf08\r\n\r\nA version of ooba's text-generation-webui, called [wawawario2/long_term_memory](https://github.com/wawawario2/long_term_memory), has done this using zarr and Numpy.

Better Privacy: Local embeddings keep user data on their devices or networks, avoiding the risk of online data breaches.\r\n2. Lower Costs: Users save money on cloud storage, bandwidth, and processing power when they use local embeddings.\r\n3. Offline Use: Auto-GPT can work in offline environments or areas with limited internet, like secure facilities or remote research stations.\r\n4. Customization: Users can create and manage their own embeddings for better model performance and results.\r\n5.

outputs.\r\n\r\nTesting: Write unit tests for each function to ensure they work as expected and to catch any potential issues during development.\r\n\r\nSecurity: Sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities, such as code injection.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Use a configuration file or environment variables to store sensitive information like API keys, rather than hardcoding them in

can be increadible\r\nOne important thing to remember, is to check each submit and flag potentially harmful insite reports\r\nThen we need to come up with a rating mechanism, like stars, flags, something like stackoverflow, that agents can mark if some insight was helpful, or not helpful, etc, and this database of solutions/insights will be a fluid and evolving knowledge base\r\nmight even be wise to allocate \"repositories\" or \"namespaces\" that can be verified by the comunity, the repo can be a client to a public pinecone server, that is managed and verified by the comunity and only accepts verified insight submissions\r\n\r\nLike a good fleet, we need to share with eachother all the safe and useful progress, and flag bad practices\r\n\r\nIf you get my drift, please tag relevant

This feature combines the benefits of Continuous Mode with the human-in-the-loop experience of Active Mode.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are two modes available:\r\n\r\n1. \"[Continuous Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/#-continuous-mode-%EF%B8%8F),\" which allows the AI to run without user authorization and is 100% automated. However, this mode is not recommended due to its potential dangers, such as running indefinitely or performing actions that users might not approve.\r\n2. \"[Active Mode](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT/issues/13),\" which enables the AI to run while actively prompting the user with chain-of-thought questions when executing each subsequent action. This allows users to actively participate while the AI agent runs, ensuring a human-in-the-loop experience.\r\n\r\nTo further enhance user engagement and provide a more flexible experience, I propose a new feature called \"Semi-Active Mode.\"\r\n\r\n## Feature Description\r\n\r\nIn \"Semi-Active Mode,\" the AI will:\r\n\r\n1. Execute an action.\r\n2. Evaluate its confidence in the action or result.\r\n3. If the confidence is below a certain threshold, prompt the user for assistance or clarification.\r\n4. Incorporate the user's input and continue to the next action.\r\n\r\nThis interaction pattern allows users to assist when needed while still benefiting from the AI's capabilities. It strikes a balance between full automation and active participation, fostering a collaborative environment between the user and the AI system.\r\n\r\n## Example Implementation\r\n\r\nHere's an example implementation using LangChain's [Human-As-A-Tool](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents/tools/examples/human_tools.html) feature:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\r\nfrom langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent\r\nfrom langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType\r\n\r\nllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)\r\nmath_llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.0)\r\ntools = load_tools(\r\n    [\"human\", \"llm-math\"], \r\n    llm=math_llm,\r\n)\r\n\r\nagent_chain = initialize_agent(\r\n    tools,\r\n    llm,\r\n    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\r\n    verbose=True,\r\n)\r\n\r\nagent_chain.run(\"What is Eric Zhu's birthday?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this code, the AI agent seeks human assistance when it encounters uncertainty, allowing the user to guide as needed.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\n-  Enhanced user engagement\r\n-  Reduced risk of AI performing unwanted actions\r\n-  Increased collaboration between the user and the AI\r\n-  Balances automation and user control\r\n\r\n## Risks and Mitigations\r\n\r\nThis feature may slow down the overall AI operation due to the need for user input in certain situations. However, this trade-off is acceptable, considering the increased control and collaboration it provides.\r\n\r\n## Request for Comments\r\n\r\nI would appreciate feedback from the community on this suggested feature.
